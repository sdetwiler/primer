{{Events leading to World War I}}
'''World War I''' ('''WWI''' or '''WW1'''), also known as the '''First World War''' or the '''Great War''', was a [[World war|global war]] centred in Europe that began on 28 July 1914 and lasted until 11 November 1918. More than 9&nbsp;million [[combatants]] and 7&nbsp;million [[civilian]]s [[World War I casualties|died as a result of the war]], a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and tactical stalemate. It was [[List of wars and anthropogenic disasters by death toll|one of the deadliest conflicts in history]], paving the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.<ref>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=307}}</ref>

The war drew in all the world's economic [[great power]]s,<ref>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|pp=10–11}}</ref> assembled in two opposing alliances: the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] (based on the [[Triple Entente]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[French Third Republic|France]] and the [[Russian Empire]]) and the [[Central Powers]] of [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]]. Although [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] had also been a member of the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] alongside Germany and Austria-Hungary, it did not join the Central Powers, as Austria-Hungary had taken the offensive against the terms of the alliance.<ref name=Willmott15>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=15}}</ref> These alliances were reorganised and expanded as more nations entered the war: Italy, [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] and the [[United States]] joined the Allies, and the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] the Central Powers. More than 70&nbsp;million [[military personnel]], including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history.<ref>{{harvnb|Keegan|1998|p=8}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bade|Brown|2003|pp=167–168}}</ref> The trigger for war was the 28 June 1914 [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]], heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, by [[Yugoslav nationalism|Yugoslav nationalist]] [[Gavrilo Princip]] in [[Sarajevo]].

Within weeks, the major powers were at war and the conflict soon spread around the world.

On 28 July, the [[Austro-Hungarian]]s declared war on Serbia and subsequently [[Serbian Campaign (World War I)|invaded]].<ref>{{harvnb|Evans|2004|p=12}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Martel|2003|p=xii ff}}</ref> As Russia mobilised in support of Serbia, Germany invaded neutral [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]] before moving towards France, leading Britain to declare war on Germany. After the German march on Paris was halted, what became known as the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] settled into a [[Attrition warfare|battle of attrition]], with a [[trench warfare|trench line]] that would change little until 1917. Meanwhile, on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]], the Russian army was successful against the Austro-Hungarians, but was stopped in its [[invasion of East Prussia]] by the Germans. In November 1914, the Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers, opening fronts in the [[Caucasus]], [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Sinai]]. Italy joined the Allies in 1915 and Bulgaria joined the Central Powers in the same year, while [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] joined the Allies in 1916, and the United States joined the Allies in 1917.

The Russian government [[February Revolution|collapsed in March 1917]], and [[October Revolution|a subsequent revolution in November]] brought the Russians to terms with the Central Powers via the [[Treaty of Brest Litovsk]], which constituted a massive German victory until nullified by the 1918 victory of the Western allies. After a stunning Spring 1918 German offensive along the Western Front, the Allies rallied and drove back the Germans in a series of successful offensives. On [[Armistice of Villa Giusti|4 November 1918]], the Austro-Hungarian empire agreed to an armistice, and Germany, which had [[German Revolution of 1918–19|its own trouble with revolutionaries]], agreed to an armistice on 11 November 1918, ending the war in victory for the Allies.

By the end of the war, the German Empire, Russian Empire, [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and the Ottoman Empire had ceased to exist. The maps were redrawn, with several independent nations restored or created, and Germany's colonies were parceled out among the winners. During the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace conference of 1919]], the [[The Big Four (WWI)|Big Four]] (Britain, France, the United States and Italy) imposed their terms in a series of treaties. The [[League of Nations]] was formed with the aim of preventing any repetition of such an appalling conflict. This, however, failed with weakened states, economic depression, renewed European nationalism, and the German feeling of humiliation contributing to the rise of [[Nazism]]. These conditions eventually contributed to [[World War II]].

== Etymology ==
From the time of its start until the approach of [[World War II]], it was called simply the '''World War''' or the '''Great War''' and thereafter the First World War or World War I.<ref>{{cite web|title=Were they always called World War I and World War II?|url=http://www.history.com/news/ask-history/were-they-always-called-world-war-i-and-world-war-ii|work=Ask History|accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Gail Braybon|title=Evidence, History, and the Great War: Historians and the Impact of 1914–18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hFqZcQmlOBsC&pg=PR8|date= 2004|publisher=Berghahn Books|page=8|isbn=978-1-57181-801-0}}</ref>

In Canada, ''[[Maclean's]] Magazine'' in October 1914 said, "Some wars name themselves. This is the Great War."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/81104 |title=great, adj., adv., and n. |work=Oxford English Dictionary |accessdate=March 2012}}</ref>  During the Interwar period (1918–1939), the war was most often called the ''World War'' and the ''Great War'' in English-speaking countries.

The term "First World War" was first used in September 1914 by the German philosopher [[Ernst Haeckel]], who claimed that "there is no doubt that the course and character of the feared 'European War'&nbsp;... will become the first world war in the full sense of the word."<ref>{{harvnb|Shapiro|Epstein|2006|p=329}} citing a wire service report in ''The Indianapolis Star'', 20 September 1914.</ref>  After the onset of the [[Second World War]] in 1939, the terms ''World War I'' or ''the First World War'' became standard, with British and Canadian historians favouring the ''First World War'', and Americans ''World War I''.

== Background ==
{{Main|Causes of World War I}}
[[File:Map Europe alliances 1914-en.svg|thumb|320px|right|Military alliances leading to World War I; [[Triple Entente]] in green; [[Central Powers]] in brown]]

=== Political and military alliances ===
In the 19th century, the major European powers had gone to great lengths to maintain a [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] throughout Europe, resulting in the existence of a complex network of political and military alliances throughout the continent by 1900.<ref name=Willmott15 /> These had started in 1815, with the [[Holy Alliance]] between [[Prussia]], Russia, and Austria. Then, in October 1873, German Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] negotiated the [[League of the Three Emperors]] (German: ''Dreikaiserbund'') between the monarchs of Austria-Hungary, Russia and Germany. This agreement failed because Austria-Hungary and Russia could not agree over Balkan policy, leaving Germany and Austria-Hungary in an alliance formed in 1879, called the [[Dual Alliance, 1879|Dual Alliance]]. This was seen as a method of countering Russian influence in the [[Balkans]] as the [[Ottoman Empire]] continued to weaken.<ref name=Willmott15 /> In 1882, this alliance was expanded to include Italy in what became the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]].<ref name=keegan52>{{harvnb|Keegan|1998|p=52}}</ref>

Bismarck had especially worked to hold Russia at Germany's side to avoid a two-front war with France and Russia. When [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] ascended to the throne as [[German Emperor]] (''Kaiser''), Bismarck was compelled to retire and his system of alliances was gradually de-emphasised. For example, the Kaiser refused to renew the [[Reinsurance Treaty]] with Russia in 1890. Two years later, the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] was signed to counteract the force of the Triple Alliance. In 1904, Britain signed a series of agreements with France, the [[Entente Cordiale]], and in 1907, Britain and Russia signed the [[Anglo-Russian Convention]]. While these agreements did not formally ally Britain with France or Russia, they made British entry into any future conflict involving France or Russia a possibility, and the system of interlocking bilateral agreements became known as the [[Triple Entente]].<ref name=Willmott15 />

=== Arms race ===
German industrial and economic power had grown greatly after [[unification of Germany|unification and the foundation of the Empire]] in 1871 following the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. From the mid-1890s on, the government of Wilhelm II used this base to devote significant economic resources for building up the ''Kaiserliche Marine'' ([[Imperial German Navy]]), established by Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], in rivalry with the British [[Royal Navy]] for world naval supremacy.<ref name=willmott21 /> As a result, each nation strove to out-build the other in [[capital ship]]s. With the launch of {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} in 1906, the British Empire expanded on its significant advantage over its German rival.<ref name=willmott21>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=21}}</ref> The arms race between Britain and Germany eventually extended to the rest of Europe, with all the major powers devoting their industrial base to producing the equipment and weapons necessary for a pan-European conflict.<ref>{{harvnb|Prior|1999|p=18}}</ref> Between 1908 and 1913, the military spending of the European powers increased by 50%.<ref name="Fromkin2004">{{harvnb|Fromkin|2004|p=94}}</ref>

[[File:1908-10-07 - Moritz Schiller's Delicatessen.jpg|thumb|250px|Sarajevo citizens reading a poster with the proclamation of the [[Bosnian Crisis|Austrian annexation in 1908]].]]

=== Conflicts in the Balkans ===

Austria-Hungary precipitated the [[Bosnian crisis]] of 1908–1909 by officially annexing the former Ottoman territory of [[Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina, which it had occupied since 1878]]. This angered the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and its patron, the [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Russian Empire]].<ref name=keegan48-49>{{harvnb|Keegan|1998|pp=48–49}}</ref> Russian political manoeuvring in the region destabilised peace accords, which were already fracturing in what was known as the "[[powder keg of Europe]]".<ref name=keegan48-49 /> In 1912 and 1913, the [[First Balkan War]] was fought between the [[Balkan League]] and the fracturing Ottoman Empire. The resulting [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] further shrank the Ottoman Empire, creating an independent Albanian State while enlarging the territorial holdings of Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, and Greece. When Bulgaria attacked Serbia and Greece on 16 June 1913, it lost most of Macedonia to Serbia and Greece and [[Southern Dobruja]] to Romania in the 33-day [[Second Balkan War]], further destabilising the region.<ref name=Willmott22-23>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|pp=2–23}}</ref>

=== Sarajevo assassination ===
{{Main|Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand}}

On 28 June 1914, Austrian [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] visited the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] capital, [[Sarajevo]]. A group of six assassins ([[Cvjetko Popović]], [[Gavrilo Princip]], [[Muhamed Mehmedbašić]], [[Nedeljko Čabrinović]], [[Trifko Grabež]], [[Vaso Čubrilović]]) from the nationalist group [[Young Bosnia|Mlada Bosna]], supplied by the [[Black Hand (Serbia)|Black Hand]], had gathered on the street where the Archduke's motorcade would pass. Čabrinović threw a [[hand grenade|grenade]] at the car, but missed. Some nearby were injured by the blast, but Franz Ferdinand's convoy carried on. The other assassins failed to act as the cars drove past them. About an hour later, when Franz Ferdinand was returning from a visit at the Sarajevo Hospital with those wounded in the assassination attempt, the convoy took a wrong turn into a street where, by coincidence, Princip stood. With a pistol, Princip shot and killed Franz Ferdinand and his wife [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg|Sophie]]. The reaction among the people in Austria was mild, almost indifferent. As historian [[Zbyněk Zeman]] later wrote, "the event almost failed to make any impression whatsoever. On Sunday and Monday (28 and 29 June), the crowds in Vienna listened to music and drank wine, as if nothing had happened."<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/european-powers-maintain-focus-despite-killings-in-sarajevo|title=European powers maintain focus despite killings in Sarajevo&nbsp;— History.com This Day in History&nbsp;— 6/30/1914|publisher=History.com|accessdate=26 December 2013}}</ref><ref name="Willmott26">{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=26}}</ref>

=== Escalation of violence in Bosnia and Herzegovina ===
{{Main|Anti-Serb riots in Sarajevo|Schutzkorps}}

However, in Sarajevo itself, Austrian authorities encouraged violence against the Serb residents, which resulted in the [[Anti-Serb riots of Sarajevo]], in which [[Croats]] and [[Bosnian Muslims]] killed two ethnic Serbs and damaged numerous Serb-owned buildings.<ref name="DjordjevićSpence1992">{{cite book|author1=Dimitrije Djordjević|author2=Richard B.

=== July Crisis ===
{{Main|July Crisis}}

The assassination led to a month of diplomatic manoeuvring between Austria-Hungary, Germany, Russia, France, and Britain called the [[July Crisis]]. Believing correctly that Serbian officials (especially the officers of the Black Hand) were involved in the plot to murder the Archduke, and wanting to finally end Serbian interference in Bosnia,<ref>{{harvnb|Stevenson|1996|p=12}}</ref> Austria-Hungary delivered to Serbia on 23 July the [[July Crisis#Content of the Austro-Hungarian ultimatum to Serbia|July Ultimatum]], a series of ten demands that were made intentionally unacceptable, in an effort to provoke a war with Serbia.<ref name=Willmott27>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=27}}</ref> The next day, after the Council of Ministers was held under the chairmanship of the Tsar at Krasnoe Selo, Russia ordered general mobilization for Odessa, Kiev, Kazan and Moscow military districts and fleets of the Baltic and the Black Sea. They also asked for other regions to accelerate preparations for general mobilization. Serbia decreed general mobilization on the 25th and at night, declared that they accepted all the terms of the ultimatum, except the one claiming that Austrian investigators visit the country. Following this, Austria broke off diplomatic relations with Serbia, and the next day ordered a partial mobilization. Finally, on 28 July 1914, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia.

On 29 July, Russia, unwilling to allow Austria-Hungary to eliminate its influence in the Balkans, and in support of its Serb protégé, unilaterally declared – outside of the conciliation procedure provided by the Franco-Russian military agreements – partial mobilization against Austria-Hungary. German Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg was then allowed until the 31st for an appropriate response. On the 30th, Russia ordered general mobilization against Germany. In response, the following day, Germany declared a "state of danger of war." This also led to the general mobilization in Austria-Hungary on 4 August. Kaiser Wilhelm II asked his cousin, Tsar Nicolas II, to suspend the Russian general mobilization. When he refused, Germany issued an ultimatum demanding the arrest of its mobilization and commitment not to support Serbia. Another was sent to France, asking her not to support Russia if it were to come to the defence of Serbia. On 1 August, after the Russian response, Germany mobilized and declared war on Russia.

The German government issued demands that France remain neutral as they had to decide which deployment plan to implement, it being difficult if not impossible to change the deployment whilst it was underway. The modified German [[Schlieffen Plan]], ''Aufmarsch II West'', would deploy 80% of the army in the west, and ''Aufmarsch I Ost'' and ''Aufmarsch II Ost'' would deploy 60% in the west and 40% in the east as this was the maximum that the East Prussian railway infrastructure could carry. The French did not respond but sent a mixed message by ordering their troops to withdraw {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} from the border to avoid any incidents while ordering the mobilisation of her reserves. Germany responded by mobilising its own reserves and implementing ''Aufmarsch II West''. Germany attacked Luxembourg on 2 August and on 3 August declared war on France.<ref name=Crowe>{{cite book|last=Crowe|first=David|title=The Essentials of European History: 1914 to 1935, World War I and Europe in Crisis|year=2001|publisher=Research & Education Assoc.|isbn=978-0-7386-7106-2|pages=4–5}}</ref>  On 4 August, after Belgium refused to permit German troops to cross its borders into France, Germany declared war on Belgium as well.<ref name=Crowe /><ref>{{cite book|last=Dell|first=Pamela|title=A World War I Timeline (Smithsonian War Timelines Series)|year=2013|publisher=Capstone|isbn=978-1-4765-4159-4|pages=10–12}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=29}}</ref> Britain declared war on Germany at 7 pm UTC on 4 August 1914 (effective from 11 pm), following an "unsatisfactory reply" to the British ultimatum that Belgium must be kept [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/mirror01_01.shtml|publisher=BBC|title=Daily Mirror Headlines: The Declaration of War, Published 4 August 1914|accessdate=9 February 2010}}</ref>

== Progress of the war ==

=== Opening hostilities ===

==== Confusion among the Central Powers ====
The strategy of the Central Powers suffered from miscommunication. Germany had promised to support Austria-Hungary's invasion of Serbia, but interpretations of what this meant differed. Previously tested deployment plans had been replaced early in 1914, but had never been tested in exercises. Austro-Hungarian leaders believed Germany would cover its northern flank against Russia.<ref>{{harvnb|Strachan|2003|pp=292–296, 343–354}}</ref><!-- may be able to find more on this in Samuel R. Williamson, Jr: "Austria-Hungary and the Origins of the First World War" --> Germany, however, envisioned Austria-Hungary directing most of its troops against Russia, while Germany dealt with France. This confusion forced the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] to divide its forces between the Russian and Serbian fronts.

==== Serbian campaign ====
[[File:FirstSerbianArmedPlane1915.jpg|thumbnail|Serbian Army [[Blériot XI]] "Oluj", 1915.]]
{{Main|Serbian Campaign (World War I)}}

Austria invaded and fought the Serbian army at the [[Battle of Cer]] and [[Battle of Kolubara]] beginning on 12 August. Over the next two weeks, Austrian attacks were thrown back with heavy losses, which marked the first major Allied victories of the war and dashed Austro-Hungarian hopes of a swift victory. As a result, Austria had to keep sizable forces on the Serbian front, weakening its efforts against Russia.<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=172}}</ref> Serbia's defeat of the Austro-Hungarian invasion of 1914 counts among the major upset victories of the last century.<ref>{{cite web|author=John R.

==== German forces in Belgium and France ====
{{Main|Western Front (World War I)}}

[[File:Hospital ward.jpg|thumb|left|British hospital at the Western Front.]]

At the outbreak of World War I, 80% of the German army (consisting in the West of [[German Army order of battle (1914)|seven field armies]]) was deployed in the west according to the plan ''Aufmarsch II West''. However, they were then assigned the operation of the retired deployment plan ''Aufmarsch I West'', also known as the Schlieffen Plan. This would march German armies through northern Belgium and into France, in an attempt to encircle the French army and then breach the 'second defensive area' of the fortresses of [[Verdun]] and Paris and the Marne river.<ref name=AJPT2 />

''Aufmarsch I West'' was one of four deployment plans available to the German General Staff in 1914, each plan favouring but not specifying a certain operation that was well-known to the officers expected to carry it out under their own initiative with minimal oversight. ''Aufmarsch I West'', designed for a one-front war with France, had been retired once it became clear that it was irrelevant to the wars Germany could expect to face; both Russia and Britain were expected to help France and there was no possibility of Italian nor Austro-Hungarian troops being available for operations against France. But despite its unsuitability, and the availability of more sensible and decisive options, it retained a certain allure due to its offensive nature and the pessimism of pre-war thinking, which expected offensive operations to be short-lived, costly in casualties and unlikely to be decisive. Accordingly, the ''Aufmarsch II West'' deployment was changed for the offensive of 1914, despite its unrealistic goals and the insufficient forces Germany had available for decisive success.{{sfn|Holmes|2014|pp=194, 211}}

The plan called for the right flank of the German advance to bypass the French armies concentrated on the Franco-German border, defeat the French forces closer to Luxembourg and Belgium and move south to Paris. Initially the Germans were successful, particularly in the [[Battle of the Frontiers]] (14–24 August). By 12 September, the French, with assistance from the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF), halted the German advance east of Paris at the [[First Battle of the Marne]] (5–12 September), and pushed the German forces back some {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}}. The French offensive into southern Alsace, launched on 20 August with the [[Battle of Mulhouse]], had limited success.

In the east, the Russians invaded with two armies. In response, Germany rapidly moved the [[8th Army (German Empire)|8th Field Army]] from its previous role as reserve for the invasion of France, to [[East Prussia]] by rail across the German Empire. This army, led by general [[Paul von Hindenburg]] defeated Russia in a series of battles collectively known as the First [[Battle of Tannenberg]] (17 August&nbsp;– 2 September). While the Russian invasion failed, it caused the diversion of German troops to the east, allowing the tactical Allied victory at the First Battle of the Marne. This meant that Germany failed to achieve its objective of avoiding a long two-front war. However, the German army had fought its way into a good defensive position inside France and effectively halved France's supply of coal. It had also killed or permanently crippled 230,000 more French and British troops than it itself had lost. Despite this, communications problems and questionable command decisions cost Germany the chance of a more decisive outcome.<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|pp=376–8}}</ref>

New Zealand [[Occupation of German Samoa|occupied]] [[German Samoa]] (later Western Samoa) on 30 August 1914. On 11 September, the [[Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force]] landed on the island of [[New Britain|Neu Pommern]] (later New Britain), which formed part of [[German New Guinea]]. On 28 October, the German cruiser {{SMS|Emden|1908|6}} sank the [[Russian cruiser Zhemchug]] in the [[Battle of Penang]]. Japan seized Germany's Micronesian colonies and, after the [[Siege of Tsingtao]], the German coaling port of [[Qingdao]] on the Chinese [[Shandong]] peninsula.

{{Main|African theatre of World War I}}

Some of the first clashes of the war involved British, French, and German colonial forces in Africa. On 6–7 August, French and British troops invaded the German protectorate of [[Togoland]] and [[Kamerun]]. On 10 August, German forces in [[German South-West Africa|South-West Africa]] attacked South Africa; sporadic and fierce fighting continued for the rest of the war. The German colonial forces in [[German East Africa]], led by Colonel [[Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck]], fought a [[guerrilla warfare]] campaign during World War I and only surrendered two weeks after the armistice took effect in Europe.<ref>{{harvnb|Farwell|1989|p=353}}</ref>

==== Indian support for the Allies ====
{{Further2|[[Third Anglo-Afghan War]]|[[Hindu–German Conspiracy]]}}

Contrary to British fears of a revolt in India, the outbreak of the war saw an unprecedented outpouring of loyalty and goodwill towards Britain.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown|1994|pp=197–198}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Brown|1994|pp=201–203}}</ref> Indian political leaders from the [[Indian National Congress]] and other groups were eager to support the British war effort, since they believed that strong support for the war effort would further the cause of [[Indian Home Rule Movement|Indian Home Rule]]. The [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]] in fact outnumbered the British Army at the beginning of the war; about 1.3&nbsp;million Indian soldiers and labourers served in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, while the central government and the [[princely state]]s sent large supplies of food, money, and ammunition. In all, 140,000&nbsp;men served on the Western Front and nearly 700,000 in the Middle East. Casualties of Indian soldiers totalled 47,746 killed and 65,126 wounded during World War I.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.mgtrust.org/ind1.htm|title=Participants from the Indian subcontinent in the First World War|publisher=Memorial Gates Trust|accessdate=12 December 2008|author1=<Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.>}}</ref>
The suffering engendered by the war, as well as the failure of the British government to grant self-government to India after the end of hostilities, bred disillusionment and fuelled [[Indian independence movement|the campaign for full independence]] that would be led by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] and others.

=== Western Front ===
{{Main|Western Front (World War I)}}

==== Trench warfare begins ====
[[File:Royal Irish Rifles ration party Somme July 1916.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Mud stained British soldiers at rest |[[Royal Irish Rifles]] in a communications trench, [[first day on the Somme]], 1916.]]
Military tactics before World War I had failed to keep pace with advances in technology and had become obsolete. These advances had allowed the creation of strong defensive systems, which out-of-date military tactics could not break through for most of the war. [[Barbed wire]] was a significant hindrance to massed infantry advances, while [[artillery]], vastly<!--between HE & hydraulic recoil mechanisms, something like two orders of magnitude--> more lethal than in the 1870s, coupled with [[machine gun]]s, made crossing open ground extremely difficult.<ref>{{harvnb|Raudzens|1990|pp=424}}</ref> Commanders on both sides failed to develop tactics for [[trench warfare|breaching entrenched]] positions without heavy casualties. In time, however, technology began to produce new offensive weapons, such as [[Chemical weapons in World War I|gas warfare]] and the [[Tanks in World War I|tank]].<ref>{{harvnb|Raudzens|1990|pp=421–423}}</ref>

Just after the First Battle of the Marne (5–12 September 1914), Entente and German forces repeatedly attempted manoeuvring to the north to outflank each other: this series of manoeuvres became known as the "[[Race to the Sea]]". When these outflanking efforts failed, Britain and France soon found themselves facing an uninterrupted line of entrenched German forces from [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]] to Belgium's coast.<ref name=AJPT2 /> Britain and France sought to take the offensive, while Germany defended the occupied territories. Consequently, German trenches were much better constructed than those of their enemy; Anglo-French trenches were only intended to be "temporary" before their forces broke through the German defences.<ref>{{harvnb|Goodspeed|1985|p=199 (footnote)}}</ref>

Both sides tried to break the stalemate using scientific and technological advances. On 22 April 1915, at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]], the Germans (violating the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Convention]]) used [[chlorine]] gas for the first time on the Western Front. Several types of gas soon became widely used by both sides, and though it never proved a decisive, battle-winning weapon, poison gas became one of the most-feared and best-remembered horrors of the war.<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Duffy |url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/weaponry/gas.htm |title=Weapons of War: Poison Gas |publisher=Firstworldwar.com |date=22 August 2009 |accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Love|1996}}</ref> Tanks were first used in combat by the British during the [[Battle of Flers–Courcelette]] (part of the Battle of the Somme) on 15 September 1916, with only partial success. However, their effectiveness would grow as the war progressed; the Germans employed only small numbers of their own design, supplemented by captured Allied tanks.

==== Continuation of trench warfare ====

Neither side proved able to deliver a decisive blow for the next two years. Throughout 1915–17, the British Empire and France suffered more casualties than Germany, because of both the strategic and tactical stances chosen by the sides. Strategically, while the Germans only mounted one major offensive, the Allies made several attempts to break through the German lines.

In February 1916 the Germans attacked the French defensive positions at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]]. Lasting until December 1916, the battle saw initial German gains, before French counter-attacks returned matters to near their starting point. Casualties were greater for the French, but the Germans bled heavily as well, with anywhere from 700,000<ref>{{harvnb|Dupuy|1993|pp=1042}}</ref> to 975,000<ref>{{harvnb|Grant|2005|pp=276}}</ref> casualties suffered between the two combatants.

The [[Battle of the Somme]] was an Anglo-French offensive that ran from July to November 1916. The opening of this offensive (1 July 1916) saw the [[British Army]] endure the bloodiest day in its history, suffering 57,470 casualties, including 19,240 dead, on the [[first day on the Somme|first day]] alone. The entire Somme offensive cost the British Army some 420,000 casualties. The French suffered another estimated 200,000 casualties and the Germans an estimated 500,000.<ref>{{harvnb|Harris|2008|pp=271}}</ref>

Protracted action at Verdun throughout 1916,<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=1221}}</ref> combined with the bloodletting at the Somme, brought the exhausted French army to the brink of collapse. Futile attempts at [[frontal assault]] came at a high price for both the British and the French and led to the widespread [[French Army Mutinies]], after the failure of the costly [[Nivelle Offensive]] of April–May 1917.<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=854}}</ref> The concurrent British [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]] was more limited in scope, and more successful, although ultimately of little strategic value.<ref>{{harvnb|Keegan|1998|pp=325–326}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Strachan|2003|pp=244}}</ref> A smaller part of the Arras offensive, the capture of [[Battle of Vimy Ridge|Vimy Ridge]] by the [[Canadian Corps]], became highly significant to that country: the idea that Canada's national identity was born out of the battle is an opinion widely held in military and general histories of Canada.<ref>{{harvnb|Inglis|1995|pp=2}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Humphries|2007|pp=66}}</ref>

The last large-scale offensive of this period was a British attack (with French support) at [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]] (July–November 1917). This offensive opened with great promise for the Allies, before bogging down in the October mud. Casualties, though disputed, were roughly equal, at some 200,000–400,000 per side.

These years of trench warfare in the West saw no major exchanges of territory and, as a result, are often thought of as static and unchanging. However, throughout this period, British, French, and German [[Tactical development on the Western Front in 1917|tactics constantly evolved]] to meet new battlefield challenges.

=== Naval war ===
[[File:Hochseeflotte 2.jpg|thumb|right|Battleships of the [[High Seas Fleet|''Hochseeflotte'']], 1917. ]]
{{Main|Naval warfare of World War I}}

At the start of the war, the German Empire had [[cruiser]]s scattered across the globe, some of which were subsequently used to attack Allied [[merchant shipping]]. The British Royal Navy systematically hunted them down, though not without some embarrassment from its inability to protect Allied shipping. For example, the German detached light cruiser SMS ''Emden'', part of the East-Asia squadron stationed at Qingdao, seized or destroyed 15 merchantmen, as well as sinking a Russian cruiser and a French destroyer. However, most of the [[German East Asia Squadron|German East-Asia squadron]]—consisting of the armoured cruisers {{SMS|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{SMS|Gneisenau||2}}, light cruisers {{SMS|Nürnberg|1906|2}} and {{SMS|Leipzig||2}} and two transport ships—did not have orders to raid shipping and was instead underway to Germany when it met British warships. The German flotilla and {{SMS|Dresden|1907|2}} sank two armoured cruisers at the [[Battle of Coronel]], but was almost destroyed at the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]] in December 1914, with only ''Dresden'' and a few auxiliaries escaping, but at the [[Battle of Más a Tierra]] these too were destroyed or interned.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|pp=39–47}}</ref>

Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval [[blockade of Germany]]. The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.<ref name="isbn0-313-33181-2">{{harvnb|Keene|2006|p=5}}</ref> Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of ocean, causing danger to even neutral ships.<ref name="isbn1-85728-498-4">{{harvnb|Halpern|1995|p=293}}</ref> Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.<ref name="isbn0-8476-9645-6">{{harvnb|Zieger|2001|p=50}}</ref>

The 1916 [[Battle of Jutland]] (German: ''Skagerrakschlacht'', or "Battle of the [[Skagerrak]]") developed into the largest naval battle of the war, the only full-scale clash of battleships during the war, and one of the largest in history. It took place on 31 May&nbsp;– 1 June 1916, in the [[North Sea]] off [[Jutland]]. The Kaiserliche Marine's High Seas Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]], squared off against the Royal Navy's [[Grand Fleet]], led by Admiral Sir [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|John Jellicoe]]. The engagement was a stand off, as the Germans, outmanoeuvred by the larger British fleet, managed to escape and inflicted more damage to the British fleet than they received. Strategically, however, the British asserted their control of the sea, and the bulk of the German surface fleet remained confined to port for the duration of the war.<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|pp=619–24}}</ref>

The U-boat threat lessened in 1917, when merchant ships began travelling in [[Convoys in World War I|convoys]], escorted by [[destroyer]]s. This tactic made it difficult for U-boats to find targets, which significantly lessened losses; after the [[hydrophone]] and [[depth charge]]s were introduced, accompanying destroyers could attack a submerged submarine with some hope of success. Convoys slowed the flow of supplies, since ships had to wait as convoys were assembled. The solution to the delays was an extensive program of building new freighters. Troopships were too fast for the submarines and did not travel the North Atlantic in convoys.<ref>{{citation|url=http://nslegislature.ca/index.php/committees/committee_hansard/C11/va_2006nov09|title=Committee Hansard|date=9 November 2006|author1=Nova Scotia House of Assembly Committee on Veterans' Affairs|accessdate=12 March 2013|work=Hansard}}</ref> The U-boats had sunk more than 5,000 Allied ships, at a cost of 199 submarines.<ref>{{Citation|author=Roger Chickering, Stig Förster, Bernd Greiner; German Historical Institute |location=Washington, D.C. |year=2005 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=evVPoSwqrG4C&pg=PA73 73] |title=A world at total war: global conflict and the politics of destruction, 1937–1945 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-83432-5 }}</ref> World War I also saw the first use of [[aircraft carrier]]s in combat, with {{HMS|Furious|47|6}} launching [[Sopwith Camel]]s in a successful raid against the [[Zeppelin]] hangars at [[Tondern raid|Tondern]] in July 1918, as well as [[blimp]]s for antisubmarine patrol.<ref name="price1980">{{harvnb|Price|1980}}</ref>

Faced with Russia, Austria-Hungary could spare only one-third of its army to attack Serbia. After suffering heavy losses, the Austrians briefly occupied the Serbian capital, [[Belgrade]]. A Serbian counter-attack in the Battle of Kolubara succeeded in driving them from the country by the end of 1914. For the first ten months of 1915, Austria-Hungary used most of its military reserves to fight Italy. German and Austro-Hungarian diplomats, however, scored a coup by persuading Bulgaria to join the attack on Serbia on 6 September 1915 in Pless.<ref name="TuckerRoberts2005">{{cite book|author1=Spencer Tucker|author2=Priscilla Mary Roberts|title=World War One|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2YqjfHLyyj8C&pg=PA241|date=1 January 2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-420-2|pages=241–}}</ref> The Austro-Hungarian provinces of [[Slovenia]], Croatia and [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] provided troops for Austria-Hungary, invading Serbia as well as fighting Russia and Italy.

Serbia was conquered in a little more than a month, as the Central Powers, now including Bulgaria, sent in 600,000 troops. The Serbian army, fighting on two fronts and facing certain defeat, retreated into northern [[Principality of Albania|Albania]]. The Serbs suffered defeat in the [[Kosovo Offensive (1915)|Battle of Kosovo]]. Montenegro covered the Serbian retreat towards the Adriatic coast in the [[Battle of Mojkovac]] in 6–7 January 1916, but ultimately the Austrians also conquered Montenegro. The surviving Serbian soldiers were evacuated by ship to Greece.<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|pp=1075–6}}</ref> After conquest, Serbia was divided between Austro-Hungary and Bulgaria.

In late 1915, a Franco-British force landed at [[Salonica]] in Greece, to offer assistance and to pressure its government to declare war against the Central Powers. However, the pro-German [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I]] dismissed the pro-Allied government of [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] before the Allied expeditionary force arrived.<ref>{{harvnb|Neiberg|2005|pp=108–10}}</ref> The friction between the King of Greece and the Allies continued to accumulate with the [[National Schism]], which effectively divided Greece between regions still loyal to the king and the new provisional government of Venizelos in Salonica. After intense negotiations and an armed confrontation in [[Athens]] between Allied and royalist forces (an incident known as [[Noemvriana]]), the King of Greece resigned and his second son [[Alexander of Greece|Alexander]] took his place; Greece then officially joined the war on the side of the Allies.

In the beginning, the Macedonian Front was mostly static. French and Serbian forces retook limited areas of Macedonia by recapturing [[Bitola]] on 19 November 1916 following the costly [[Monastir Offensive]], which brought stabilization of the front.<ref>{{cite book| last=Hall| first=Richard| title=Balkan Breakthrough: The Battle of Dobro Pole 1918|year=2010| publisher=Indiana University Press | location=|page=11|ISBN=0-253-35452-8}}</ref>

Serbian and French troops finally made a breakthrough in September 1918, after most of the German and Austro-Hungarian troops had been withdrawn. The Bulgarians suffered their only defeat of the war at the [[Battle of Dobro Pole]]. Bulgaria capitulated two weeks later, on 29 September 1918.<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Wood|Murphy|1999|p=120}}</ref> The German high command responded by despatching troops to hold the line, but these forces were far too weak to reestablish a front.<ref name=militera>{{cite web|url=http://militera.lib.ru/h/korsun_ng4/06.html |title=The Balkan Front of the World War |language=Russian |first=N. |last=Korsun |publisher=militera.lib.ru |accessdate=27 September 2010}}</ref>

The disappearance of the Macedonian Front meant that the road to [[Budapest]] and [[Vienna]] was now opened to Allied forces. Hindenburg and Ludendorff concluded that the strategic and operational balance had now shifted decidedly against the [[Central Powers]] and, a day after the Bulgarian collapse, insisted on an immediate peace settlement.<ref name=Doughty>{{harvnb|Doughty|2005|p=491}}</ref>

The British and French opened overseas fronts with the [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] (1915) and [[Mesopotamian campaign]]s (1914). In Gallipoli, the Ottoman Empire successfully repelled the British, French, and [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] (ANZACs). In [[Mesopotamia]], by contrast, after the disastrous [[Siege of Kut]] (1915–16), British Imperial forces reorganised and captured [[Baghdad]] in March 1917. The British were aided in Mesopotamia by local Arab and Assyrian tribesmen, while the Ottomans employed local Kurdish and Turcoman tribes.<ref>Arthur J. Barker, ''The Neglected War: Mesopotamia, 1914–1918'' (London: Faber, 1967)</ref>

Further to the west, the Suez Canal was defended from Ottoman attacks in 1915 and 1916; in August, a German and Ottoman force was defeated at the [[Battle of Romani]] by the [[ANZAC Mounted Division]] and the [[52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division]]. Following this victory, a [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] advanced across the [[Sinai Peninsula]], pushing Ottoman forces back in the [[Battle of Magdhaba]] in December and the [[Battle of Rafa]] on the border between the Egyptian [[Sinai]] and Ottoman Palestine in January 1917.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Crawford and Ian McGibbon|title=New Zealand's Great War: New Zealand, the Allies and the First World War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mtEEuD_-2SMC&pg=PA219|year=2007|publisher=Exisle Publishing|pages=219–20}}</ref>

Russian armies generally saw success in the Caucasus. [[Enver Pasha]], supreme commander of the Ottoman armed forces, was ambitious and dreamed of re-conquering central Asia and areas that had been lost to Russia previously. He was, however, a poor commander.<ref name="isbn0-8050-6884-8">{{harvnb|Fromkin|2001|p=119}}</ref> He launched an offensive against the Russians in the Caucasus in December 1914 with 100,000 troops; insisting on a frontal attack against mountainous Russian positions in winter.

In December 1914 the Ottoman Empire, with German support, invaded [[Persia]] (modern [[Iran]]) in an effort to cut off British and Russian access to [[petroleum reservoir]]s around [[Baku]] near the [[Caspian Sea]].<ref>a b c The Encyclopedia Americana, 1920, v.28, p.403</ref> Persia, ostensibly neutral, had long been under the spheres of British and Russian influence.

The [[Persian Campaign]] was to last until 1918 and end in failure for the Ottomans and their allies, however the Russian withdrawal from the war in 1917 led to Armenian and Assyrian forces, who had hitherto inflicted a series of defeats upon the forces of the Ottomans and their allies, being cut off from supply lines, outnumbered, outgunned and isolated, forcing them to fight and flee towards British lines in northern Mesopotamia.<ref>a b c d e f g (Northcote 1922, pp. 788)</ref>

General [[Nikolai Yudenich|Yudenich]], the Russian commander from 1915 to 1916, drove the Turks out of most of the southern Caucasus with a string of victories.<ref name=caven /> In 1917, Russian [[Grand Duke Nicholas]] assumed command of the Caucasus front. Nicholas planned a railway from Russian Georgia to the conquered territories, so that fresh supplies could be brought up for a new offensive in 1917. However, in March 1917 (February in the pre-revolutionary Russian calendar), the Czar abdicated in the course of the [[February Revolution]] and the [[Russian Caucasus Army (World War I)|Russian Caucasus Army]] began to fall apart.

Instigated by the Arab bureau of the British [[Foreign Office]], the [[Arab Revolt]] started June 1916 at the [[Battle of Mecca (1916)|Battle of Mecca]], led by [[Sherif Hussein]] of [[Mecca]], and ended with the Ottoman surrender of Damascus. [[Fakhri Pasha]], the Ottoman commander of [[Medina]], resisted for more than two and half years during the [[Siege of Medina]] before surrendering.<ref>{{harvnb|Sachar|1970|pp=122–138}}</ref>

Along the border of Italian Libya and British Egypt, the [[Senussi]] tribe, incited and armed by the Turks, waged a small-scale guerrilla war against Allied troops. The British were forced to dispatch 12,000 troops to oppose them in the [[Senussi Campaign]]. Their rebellion was finally crushed in mid-1916.<ref>{{harvnb|Gilbert|1994}}</ref>

Total Allied casualties on the Ottoman fronts amounted 650,000 men.

Italy had been allied with the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires since 1882 as part of the Triple Alliance. However, the nation had its own designs on Austrian territory in [[Trentino]], the [[Austrian Littoral]], [[Rijeka|Fiume]] (Rijeka) and [[Dalmatia]]. Rome had a secret 1902 pact with France, effectively nullifying its alliance.<ref>{{cite book|author=Professor Hall Gardner|title=The Failure to Prevent World War I: The Unexpected Armageddon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=631TBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA120|year=2015|publisher=Ashgate|page=120}}</ref> At the start of hostilities, Italy refused to commit troops, arguing that the Triple Alliance was defensive and that Austria-Hungary was an aggressor. The Austro-Hungarian government began negotiations to secure Italian neutrality, offering the French colony of Tunisia in return. The Allies made a counter-offer in which Italy would receive the [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol|Southern Tyrol]], Austrian Littoral and territory on the Dalmatian coast after the defeat of Austria-Hungary. This was formalised by the [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]]. Further encouraged by the Allied invasion of Turkey in April 1915, Italy joined the Triple Entente and declared war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May. Fifteen months later, Italy declared war on Germany.<ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas Nelson Page|title=Italy and the world war|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nQgyAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA206|year=1920|publisher=Scribners|pages=142–208}}</ref>

The Italians had numerical superiority but this advantage was lost, not only because of the difficult terrain in which fighting took place, but also because of the strategies and tactics employed.<ref>{{cite book | first=S. L. A. | last=Marshall | authorlink=Samuel Lyman Atwood Marshall | title=The American Heritage History of World War I | publisher=[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]] | location=New York|page=108}}</ref> [[Field Marshal]] [[Luigi Cadorna]], a staunch proponent of the frontal assault, had dreams of breaking into the Slovenian plateau, taking [[Ljubljana]] and threatening Vienna.

On the Trentino front, the Austro-Hungarians took advantage of the mountainous terrain, which favoured the defender. After an initial strategic retreat, the front remained largely unchanged, while Austrian [[Kaiserschützen]] and [[Standschützen]] engaged Italian [[Alpini]] in bitter hand-to-hand combat throughout the summer. The Austro-Hungarians counterattacked in the [[Asiago|Altopiano of Asiago]], towards Verona and Padua, in the spring of 1916 (''[[Battle of Asiago|Strafexpedition]]''), but made little progress.<ref>{{cite book | first= Mark | last = Thompson | title= The White War: Life and Death on the Italian Front, 1915–1919 |publisher= London: Faber and Faber |page = 163}}</ref>

Beginning in 1915, the Italians under Cadorna mounted eleven offensives on the [[Battles of the Isonzo|Isonzo front]] along the [[Soča|Isonzo]] (Soča) River, northeast of [[Trieste]]. All eleven offensives were repelled by the Austro-Hungarians, who held the higher ground. In the summer of 1916, after the [[Battle of Doberdò]], the Italians captured the town of [[Gorizia]]. After this minor victory, the front remained static for over a year, despite several Italian offensives, centred on the [[Banjšice Plateau|Banjšice]] and Karst Plateau east of Gorizia.

The Central Powers launched a crushing offensive on 26 October 1917, spearheaded by the Germans. They achieved a victory at [[Battle of Caporetto|Caporetto]] ([[Kobarid]]). The Italian Army was routed and retreated more than {{convert|100|km|mi}} to reorganise, stabilising the front at the [[Battle of the Piave River|Piave River]]. Since the Italian Army had suffered heavy losses in the Battle of Caporetto, the Italian Government called to arms the so-called '''99 Boys'' (''Ragazzi del '99''): that is, all males born on 1899 and after, and so were 18 years old or older. In 1918, the Austro-Hungarians failed to break through in a series of battles on the Piave and were finally decisively defeated in the [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto]] in October of that year. On 1 November, the Italian Navy destroyed much of the Austro-Hungarian fleet stationed in [[Pula]], preventing it from being handed over to the new [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]]. On 3 November, the Italians occupied Trieste from the sea. On the same day, the [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]] was signed. By mid-November 1918, the Italian military occupied the entire former Austrian Littoral and had seized control of the portion of Dalmatia that had been guaranteed to Italy by the London Pact.<ref>Giuseppe Praga, Franco Luxardo.

==== Romanian participation ====
{{Main|Romania during World War I}}

[[File:Marshal Joffre inspecting Romanian troops during WWI.jpg|thumb|left|Marshal [[Joffre]] inspecting Romanian troops, 1916.]]

Romania had been allied with the Central Powers since 1882. When the war began, however, it declared its neutrality, arguing that because Austria-Hungary had itself declared war on Serbia, Romania was under no obligation to join the war. When the Entente Powers promised Romania large territories of eastern Hungary ([[Transylvania]] and [[Banat]]), which had a large Romanian population, in exchange for Romania's declaring war on the Central Powers, the Romanian government renounced its neutrality and, on 27 August 1916, the Romanian Army [[Battle of Transylvania|launched an attack]] against Austria-Hungary, with limited Russian support. The Romanian offensive was initially successful, pushing back the Austro-Hungarian troops in Transylvania, but a counterattack by the forces of the Central Powers drove back the Russo-Romanian forces.<ref>Michael B.

In January 1918, Romanian forces established control over [[Bessarabia]] as the Russian Army abandoned the province. Although a treaty was signed by the Romanian and the [[Bolshevik]] Russian governments following talks from 5–9 March 1918 on the withdrawal of Romanian forces from Bessarabia within two months, on 27 March 1918 Romania attached Bessarabia to its territory, formally based on a resolution passed by the local assembly of that territory on its unification with Romania.<ref>Clark, Charles Upson (1927). Bessarabia. New York City: Dodd, Mead.</ref>

Romania officially made peace with the Central Powers by signing the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|Treaty of Bucharest]] on 7 May 1918. Under that treaty, Romania was obliged to end the war with the Central Powers and make small territorial concessions to Austria-Hungary, ceding control of some passes in the [[Carpathian Mountains]], and to grant oil concessions to Germany. In exchange, the Central Powers recognised the sovereignty of Romania over Bessarabia. The treaty was renounced in October 1918 by the [[Alexandru Marghiloman]] government, and Romania nominally re-entered the war on 10 November 1918. The next day, the Treaty of Bucharest was nullified by the terms of the Armistice of [[Compiègne]].<ref>{{citation|last=Béla|first=Köpeczi|title=Erdély története|publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó|url=http://mek.oszk.hu/02100/02109/html/571.html}}</ref><ref>{{citation|last=Béla|first=Köpeczi|title=History of Transylvania|publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó|url=http://mek.niif.hu/03400/03407/html/429.html|isbn=84-8371-020-X}}</ref> Total Romanian deaths from 1914 to 1918, military and civilian, within contemporary borders, were estimated at 748,000.<ref>{{Citation |title=Poteri narodonaseleniia v XX veke : spravochnik|last=Erlikman|first=Vadim|year=2004|location=Moscow|isbn=5-93165-107-1}}</ref>

=== Eastern Front ===
{{Main|Eastern Front (World War I)}}

==== Initial actions ====
[[File:Russian Troops NGM-v31-p379.jpg|thumb|upright|Russian troops in a trench, awaiting a German attack, 1917.]]

While the Western Front had reached stalemate, the war continued in East Europe.<ref>Prit Buttar, ''Collision of Empires: The War on the Eastern Front in 1914'' (2014)</ref> Initial Russian plans called for simultaneous invasions of Austrian [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] and East Prussia. Although Russia's initial advance into Galicia was largely successful, it was driven back from East Prussia by Hindenburg and [[Erich Ludendorff|Ludendorff]] at the Battle of Tannenberg and the [[First Battle of the Masurian Lakes|Masurian Lakes]] in August and September 1914.<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|2005|p=715}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Meyer|2006|pp=152–4, 161, 163, 175, 182}}</ref> Russia's less developed industrial base and ineffective military leadership was instrumental in the events that unfolded.

==== Russian Revolution ====
{{Main|Russian Revolution}}

Despite the success of the June 1916 [[Brusilov Offensive]] in eastern Galicia,<ref>{{harvnb|Schindler|2003}}</ref> dissatisfaction with the Russian government's conduct of the war grew. The offensive's success was undermined by the reluctance of other generals to commit their forces to support the victory. Allied and Russian forces were revived only temporarily by Romania's entry into the war on 27 August. German forces came to the aid of embattled Austro-Hungarian units in Transylvania while a German-Bulgarian force attacked from the south, and [[Bucharest]] fell to the Central Powers on 6 December. Meanwhile, unrest grew in Russia, as the [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar]] remained at the front. [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Empress Alexandra's]] increasingly incompetent rule drew protests and resulted in the murder of her favourite, [[Grigori Rasputin|Rasputin]], at the end of 1916.

In March 1917, demonstrations in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] culminated in the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II and the appointment of a weak [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]], which shared power with the [[Petrograd Soviet]] socialists. This arrangement led to confusion and chaos both at the front and at home. The army became increasingly ineffective.<ref name="Smele" />

Following the Tsar's abdication, [[Vladimir Lenin]] was allowed passage by train back into Russia from Switzerland, and financed by Germany. Discontent and the weaknesses of the Provisional Government led to a rise in the popularity of the Bolshevik Party, led by Lenin, which demanded an immediate end to the war. The Revolution of November was followed in December by an armistice and negotiations with Germany. At first, the Bolsheviks refused the German terms, but when German troops began marching across the Ukraine unopposed, the new government acceded to the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] on 3 March 1918. The treaty ceded vast territories, including Finland, the [[Baltic states|Baltic provinces]], parts of Poland and Ukraine to the Central Powers.<ref>{{harvnb|Wheeler-Bennett|1956}}</ref> Despite this enormous apparent German success, the manpower required for German occupation of former Russian territory may have contributed to the failure of the Spring Offensive and secured relatively little food or other [[materiel]] for the Central Powers war effort.

With the adoption of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the Entente no longer existed. The Allied powers led [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|a small-scale invasion]] of Russia, partly to stop Germany from exploiting Russian resources, and to a lesser extent, to support the [[White movement|"Whites"]] (as opposed to the "Reds") in the [[Russian Civil War]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Mawdsley|2008|pp=54–55}}</ref> Allied troops landed in [[Arkhangelsk]] and in [[Vladivostok]] as part of the [[North Russia Intervention]].

==== Czechoslovak Legion ====
[[File:Czech Troops.jpg|thumb|[[Czechoslovak Legion]], Vladivostok, 1918.]]
{{Main|Czechoslovak Legion}}
The Czechoslovak Legion fought with the Entente; their goal was to win support for the independence of [[Czechoslovakia]]. The Legion in [[Russia]] was established in 1917, in December 1917 in [[France]] (including volunteers from America) and in April 1918 in [[Italy]]. Czechoslovak Legion troops defeated the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] army at the Ukrainian village [[Battle of Zborov (1917)|Zborov]] in July 1917. After this success, the number of Czechoslovak legionaries increased, as well as Czechoslovak military power. In the [[Battle of Bakhmach]], the Legion defeated the Germans and forced them to make a truce.

In Russia, they were heavily involved in the Russian Civil War fighting the [[Bolsheviks]], at times controlling most of the [[Trans-Siberian railway]] and conquering all major cities in [[Siberia]]. The presence of the Czechoslovak Legion near the [[Yekaterinburg]] appears to have been one of the motivating forces for the Bolshevik [[Shooting of the Romanov family|execution of the Tsar and his family]] in July 1918. Legionaries came less than a week afterwards and captured the city. Because Russia's European ports were not safe, the corps was to be evacuated by a long detour via the port of Vladivostok. The last transport was the American ship Heffron in September 1920.

=== Central Powers peace overtures ===
[[File:River Crossing NGM-v31-p338.jpg|thumb|right|"''[[They shall not pass]]"'', a phrase typically associated with the defense of Verdun.]]

In December 1916, after ten brutal months of the Battle of Verdun and a [[Romania during World War I#The counteroffensive of the Central Powers (September–December 1916)|successful offensive against Romania]], the Germans attempted to negotiate a peace with the Allies. Soon after, the US president, Woodrow Wilson, attempted to intervene as a peacemaker, asking in a note for both sides to state their demands. [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George's]] War Cabinet considered the German offer to be a ploy to create divisions amongst the Allies. After initial outrage and much deliberation, they took Wilson's note as a separate effort, signalling that the United States was on the verge of entering the war against Germany following the "submarine outrages". While the Allies debated a response to Wilson's offer, the Germans chose to rebuff it in favour of "a direct exchange of views". Learning of the German response, the Allied governments were free to make clear demands in their response of 14 January. They sought restoration of damages, the evacuation of occupied territories, reparations for France, Russia and Romania, and a recognition of the principle of nationalities. This included the liberation of Italians, Slavs, Romanians, Czecho-Slovaks, and the creation of a "free and united Poland". On the question of security, the Allies sought guarantees that would prevent or limit future wars, complete with sanctions, as a condition of any peace settlement.<ref>{{harvnb|Kernek|1970|pp=721–766}}</ref> The negotiations failed and the Entente powers rejected the German offer, because Germany did not state any specific proposals. To Wilson, the Entente powers stated that they would not start peace negotiations until the Central powers evacuated all occupied Allied territories and provided indemnities for all damage which had been done.<ref>Stracham (1998), p. 61</ref>

=== 1917–1918 ===

==== Developments in 1917 ====
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1983-0323-501, Kriegskinematograph im Schützengraben.jpg|thumb|German<!--UFA?--> film crew recording the action.]]

Events of 1917 proved decisive in ending the war, although their effects were not fully felt until 1918.

The British naval blockade began to have a serious impact on Germany. In response, in February 1917, the [[German General Staff]] convinced [[Chancellor]] [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]] to declare unrestricted submarine warfare, with the goal of starving Britain out of the war. German planners estimated that unrestricted submarine warfare would cost Britain a monthly shipping loss of 600,000 tons. The General Staff acknowledged that the policy would almost certainly bring the United States into the conflict, but calculated that British shipping losses would be so high that they would be forced to sue for peace after 5 to 6 months, before American intervention could make an impact. In reality, tonnage sunk rose above 500,000&nbsp;tons per month from February to July. It peaked at 860,000&nbsp;tons in April. After July, the newly re-introduced [[convoy]] system became extremely effective in reducing the U-boat threat. Britain was safe from starvation, while German industrial output fell and the United States troops joined the war in large numbers far earlier than Germany had anticipated.

[[File:Guetteur au poste de l'écluse 26.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Haut-Rhin]], France, 1917.]]

On 3 May 1917, during the Nivelle Offensive, the French 2nd Colonial Division, veterans of the Battle of Verdun, refused orders, arriving drunk and without their weapons. Their officers lacked the means to punish an entire division, and harsh measures were not immediately implemented. The French Army Mutinies eventually spread to a further 54 French divisions and saw 20,000 men desert. However, appeals to patriotism and duty, as well as mass arrests and trials, encouraged the soldiers to return to defend their trenches, although the French soldiers refused to participate in further offensive action.<ref>Marshall, 292.</ref> [[Robert Nivelle]] was removed from command by 15 May, replaced by General [[Philippe Pétain]], who suspended bloody large-scale attacks.

The victory of Austria-Hungary and Germany at the Battle of Caporetto led the Allies to convene the [[Rapallo Conference]] at which they formed the [[Supreme War Council]] to coordinate planning. Previously, British and French armies had operated under separate commands.

In December, the Central Powers signed an armistice with Russia. This released large numbers of German troops for use in the west. With German reinforcements and new American troops pouring in, the outcome was to be decided on the Western Front. The Central Powers knew that they could not win a protracted war, but they held high hopes for success based on a final quick offensive. Furthermore, the leaders of the Central Powers and the Allies became increasingly fearful of social unrest and revolution in Europe. Thus, both sides urgently sought a decisive victory.<ref name="isbn0-313-29880-7">{{harvnb|Heyman|1997|pp=146–147}}</ref>

In 1917, Emperor [[Charles I of Austria]] secretly attempted separate peace negotiations with Clemenceau, through his wife's brother [[Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma|Sixtus]] in Belgium as an intermediary, without the knowledge of Germany. Italy opposed the proposals. When the negotiations failed, his attempt was revealed to Germany resulting in a diplomatic catastrophe.<ref name="Kurlander">{{harvnb|Kurlander|2006}}</ref><ref name="Shanafelt">{{harvnb|Shanafelt|1985|pp=125–30}}</ref>

They were replaced by Indian Army units. During several months of reorganisation and training during the summer, a [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign#Summer front line operations|number of attacks]] were carried out on sections of the Ottoman front line. These pushed the front line north to more advantageous positions in preparation for an attack and to acclimatise the newly arrived Indian Army infantry. It was not until the middle of September that the integrated force was ready for large-scale operations.

The reorganised Egyptian Expeditionary Force, with an additional mounted division, broke Ottoman forces at the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]] in September 1918. In two days the British and Indian infantry, supported by a creeping barrage, broke the Ottoman front line and captured the headquarters of the [[Eighth Army (Ottoman Empire)]] at [[Battle of Tulkarm (1918)|Tulkarm]], the continuous trench lines at [[Battle of Tabsor (1918)|Tabsor]], [[Battle of Arara|Arara]] and the [[Seventh Army (Ottoman Empire)]] headquarters at [[Battle of Nablus (1918)|Nablus]]. The Desert Mounted Corps rode through the break in the front line created by the infantry and, during virtually continuous operations by [[Australian Light Horse]], British mounted Yeomanry, Indian [[Lancers]] and New Zealand [[Mounted Riflemen|Mounted Rifle]] brigades in the [[Jezreel Valley]], they captured [[Battle of Nazareth (1918)|Nazareth]], [[Capture of Afulah and Beisan|Afulah and Beisan]], [[Capture of Jenin (1918)|Jenin]], along with [[Battle of Haifa (1918)|Haifa]] on the Mediterranean coast and [[Daraa]] east of the Jordan River on the Hejaz railway. [[Battle of Samakh (1918)|Samakh]] and [[Tiberias]] on the [[Sea of Galilee]], were captured on the way northwards to [[Damascus]]. Meanwhile, [[Third Transjordan attack|Chaytor's Force]] of Australian light horse, New Zealand mounted rifles, Indian, British West Indies and Jewish infantry captured the crossings of the [[Jordan River]], [[Salt, Jordan|Es Salt]], [[Amman]] and at Ziza most of the [[Fourth Army (Ottoman Empire)]]. The [[Armistice of Mudros]], signed at the end of October, ended hostilities with the Ottoman Empire when fighting was continuing north of [[Aleppo]].

==== Entry of the United States ====
{{Main|American entry into World War I}}

[[File:USA bryter de diplomatiska förbindelserna med Tyskland 3 februari 1917.jpg|thumb|right|[[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]] before Congress, announcing the break in official relations with Germany on 3 February 1917.]]

At the outbreak of the war, the United States pursued a policy of [[non-intervention]], avoiding conflict while trying to broker a peace. When the German U-boat [[SM U-20 (Germany)|SM U-20]] [[Sinking of the RMS Lusitania|sank the British liner RMS ''Lusitania'']] on 7 May 1915 with 128 Americans among the dead, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] insisted that "America is too proud to fight" but demanded an end to attacks on passenger ships. Germany complied. Wilson unsuccessfully tried to mediate a settlement. However, he also repeatedly warned that the United States would not tolerate unrestricted submarine warfare, in violation of international law. The former president [[Theodore Roosevelt]] denounced German acts as "piracy".<ref>{{harvnb|Brands|1997|p=756}}</ref> Wilson was narrowly reelected in [[United States presidential election, 1916|1916]] as his supporters emphasized "he kept us out of war".

In January 1917, Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare, realizing it would mean American entry. The German Foreign Minister, in the [[Zimmermann Telegram]], invited Mexico to join the war as Germany's ally against the United States. In return, the Germans would finance Mexico's war and help it recover the territories of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.<ref>{{harvnb|Tuchman|1966}}</ref> The United Kingdom intercepted the message and presented it to the US embassy in the UK.  From there it made its way to President Wilson who released the Zimmermann note to the public, and Americans saw it as ''[[casus belli]]''. Wilson called on antiwar elements to end all wars, by winning this one and eliminating militarism from the globe. He argued that the war was so important that the US had to have a voice in the peace conference.<ref name="Karp-PoW-1979">{{harvnb|Karp|1979}}</ref> After the sinking of seven US merchant ships by submarines and the publication of the Zimmermann telegram, Wilson called for war on Germany,<ref>[[S: Woodrow Wilson Urges Congress to Declare War on Germany|"Woodrow Wilson Urges Congress to Declare War on Germany"]] (Wikisource)</ref> which the [[US Congress]] [[United States declaration of war on Germany (1917)|declared on 6 April 1917]].

The United States was never formally a member of the Allies but became a self-styled "Associated Power". The United States had a small army, but, after the passage of the [[Selective Service Act of 1917|Selective Service Act]], it drafted 2.8 million men,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sss.gov/induct.htm|title=Selective Service System: History and Records|publisher=Sss.gov|accessdate=27 July 2010}}</ref> and, by summer 1918, was sending 10,000 fresh soldiers to France every day. In 1917, the US Congress gave US citizenship to Puerto Ricans when they were drafted to participate in World War I, as part of the [[Jones–Shafroth Act|Jones Act]]. Germany had miscalculated, believing it would be many more months before American soldiers would arrive and that their arrival could be stopped by U-boats.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilgus|1931|p=52}}</ref>

The [[United States Navy]] sent a [[United States Battleship Division Nine (World War I)|battleship group]] to [[Scapa Flow]] to join with the British Grand Fleet, destroyers to [[Cobh|Queenstown]], [[Ireland]], and [[submarine]]s to help guard convoys. Several regiments of [[US Marines]] were also dispatched to France. The British and French wanted American units used to reinforce their troops already on the battle lines and not waste scarce shipping on bringing over supplies. General [[John J. Pershing]], [[American Expeditionary Forces]] (AEF) commander, refused to break up American units to be used as reinforcements for British Empire and French units. As an exception, he did allow African-American combat regiments to be used in French divisions. The [[Harlem Hellfighters]] fought as part of the French 16th Division, and earned a unit [[Croix de guerre 1914–1918 (France)|Croix de Guerre]] for their actions at [[Battle of Château-Thierry (1918)|Château-Thierry]], [[Battle of Belleau Wood|Belleau Wood]], and Sechault.<ref>{{citation|publisher=US [[National Archives and Records Administration]]|url=http://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/369th-infantry/|title=Teaching With Documents: Photographs of the 369th Infantry and African Americans during World War I|accessdate=29 October 2009|author1=<Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.>}}</ref> AEF doctrine called for the use of frontal assaults, which had long since been discarded by British Empire and French commanders because of the large loss of life.<ref>{{harvnb|Millett|Murray|1988|p=143}}</ref>

==== German Spring Offensive of 1918 ====
{{Main|Spring Offensive}}

Ludendorff drew up plans ([[Code name|codenamed]] [[Operation Michael]]) for the 1918 offensive on the Western Front. The Spring Offensive sought to divide the British and French forces with a series of feints and advances. The German leadership hoped to end the war before significant US forces arrived. The operation commenced on 21 March 1918, with an attack on British forces near [[Amiens]]. German forces achieved an unprecedented advance of {{convert|60|km|mi}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Westwell|2004}}</ref>

British and French trenches were penetrated using novel [[infiltration tactics]], also named ''Hutier'' tactics, after General [[Oskar von Hutier]], by specially trained units called [[Stosstruppen|stormtroopers]]. Previously, attacks had been characterised by long artillery bombardments and massed assaults. However, in the Spring Offensive of 1918, Ludendorff used artillery only briefly and infiltrated small groups of infantry at weak points. They attacked command and logistics areas and bypassed points of serious resistance. More heavily armed infantry then destroyed these isolated positions. This German success relied greatly on the element of surprise.<ref>{{harvnb|Posen|1984|pp=190¿}}</ref>

The front moved to within {{convert|120|km|mi}} of Paris. Three heavy [[Krupp]] [[railway gun]]s fired 183&nbsp;shells on the capital, causing many Parisians to flee. The initial offensive was so successful that Kaiser Wilhelm II declared 24 March a [[Public holiday|national holiday]]. Many Germans thought victory was near. After heavy fighting, however, the offensive was halted. Lacking tanks or [[Self-propelled artillery|motorised artillery]], the Germans were unable to consolidate their gains. This situation was not helped by the now stretched supply lines as a result of their rapid advance over devastated ground.<ref>{{harvnb|Gray|1991|p=86}}</ref>

[[Ferdinand Foch|General Foch]] pressed to use the arriving American troops as individual replacements, whereas Pershing sought to field American units as an independent force. These units were assigned to the depleted French and British Empire commands on 28 March. A Supreme War Council of Allied forces was created at the [[Doullens Conference]] on 5 November 1917.<ref name=moon /> General Foch was appointed as supreme commander of the Allied forces. Haig, Petain, and Pershing retained tactical control of their respective armies; Foch assumed a coordinating rather than a directing role, and the British, French, and US commands operated largely independently.<ref name=moon>{{harvnb|Moon|1996|pp=495–196}}</ref>

Following Operation Michael, Germany launched [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Operation Georgette]] against the northern [[English Channel]] ports. The Allies halted the drive after limited territorial gains by Germany. The German Army to the south then conducted [[Third Battle of the Aisne|Operations Blücher and Yorck]], pushing broadly towards Paris. Operation Marne was launched on 15 July, in an attempt to encircle [[Reims]] and beginning the [[Second Battle of the Marne]]. The resulting counterattack, which started the [[Hundred Days Offensive]], marked the first successful Allied offensive of the war.

By 20 July, the Germans had retreated across the Marne to their starting lines,<ref>{{harvnb|Rickard|2007}}</ref> having achieved little, and the German Army never regained the initiative. German casualties between March and April 1918 were 270,000, including many highly trained storm troopers.

Meanwhile, Germany was falling apart at home. [[Anti-war]] marches became frequent and morale in the army fell. Industrial output was 53% of 1913 levels.

==== New states under war zone ====
In the late spring of 1918, three new states were formed in the [[South Caucasus]]: the [[First Republic of Armenia]], the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]], and the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]], which declared their independence from the Russian Empire.<ref name="Hovannisian">{{harvnb|Hovannisian|1967|pp=1–39}}</ref> Two other minor entities were established, the [[Centrocaspian Dictatorship]] and [[South West Caucasian Republic]] (the former was liquidated by Azerbaijan in the autumn of 1918 and the latter by a joint Armenian-British task force in early 1919). With the withdrawal of the Russian armies from the Caucasus front in the winter of 1917–18, the three major republics braced for an imminent Ottoman advance, which commenced in the early months of 1918. Solidarity was briefly maintained when the [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic|Transcaucasian Federative Republic]] was created in the spring of 1918, but this collapsed in May, when the Georgians asked and received protection from Germany and the Azerbaijanis concluded a treaty with the Ottoman Empire that was more akin to a military alliance. Armenia was left to fend for itself and struggled for five months against the threat of a full-fledged occupation by the Ottoman Turks.<ref name="Hovannisian" />

=== Allied victory: summer 1918 onwards ===
[[File:Riflemen-1918-Western-Front.jpg|thumb|400px|Allies increased their front-line rifle strength while German strength fell in half in 1918<ref>Leonard P.

==== Hundred Days Offensive ====
{{Main|Hundred Days Offensive|Weimar Republic}}

[[File:Aerial view of ruins of Vaux, France, 1918, ca. 03-1918 - ca. 11-1918 - NARA - 512862.tif|thumb|Aerial view of ruins of [[Vaux-devant-Damloup]], France, 1918.]]

The Allied counteroffensive, known as the Hundred Days Offensive, began on 8 August 1918, with the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]]. The battle involved over 400 tanks and 120,000 British, [[Dominion]], and French troops, and by the end of its first day a gap {{convert |15|mi|km| abbr = on}} long had been created in the German lines. The defenders displayed a marked collapse in morale, causing  Ludendorff to refer to this day as the "Black Day of the German army".<ref>{{cite book | publisher = Vanwell | origyear = 1977 | year = 2004| title = Shock Army of the British Empire: The Canadian Corps in the Last 100 Days of the Great War | last = Schreiber | first= Shane B| place= St. Catharines, ON | isbn= 1-55125-096-9| oclc = 57063659}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Rickard|2001}}</ref> After an advance as far as {{convert|14|mi|km|0}}, German resistance stiffened, and the battle was concluded on 12 August.

Rather than continuing the Amiens battle past the point of initial success, as had been done so many times in the past, the Allies shifted their attention elsewhere. Allied leaders had now realised that to continue an attack after resistance had hardened was a waste of lives, and it was better to turn a line than to try to roll over it. They began to undertake attacks in quick order to take advantage of successful advances on the flanks, then broke them off when each attack lost its initial impetus.<ref name="Pitt-1962">{{harvnb|Pitt|2003}}</ref>

[[File:Canadian Scottish at Canal du Nord Sept 1918 IWM CO 3289.jpg|thumb|left|[[16th Battalion (Canadian Scottish), CEF|Canadian Scottish]], advancing during the [[Battle of the Canal du Nord]], 1918.]]

British and Dominion forces launched the next phase of the campaign with the [[Battle of Albert (1918)|Battle of Albert]] on 21 August.<ref>{{harvnb|Terraine|1963}}</ref> The assault was widened by French<ref name="Chron-FWW">{{harvnb|Gray|Argyle|1990}}</ref> and then further British forces in the following days. During the last week of August the pressure along a {{convert|70|mi|km|0|sing=on}} front against the enemy was heavy and unrelenting. From German accounts, "Each day was spent in bloody fighting against an ever and again on-storming enemy, and nights passed without sleep in retirements to new lines."<ref name="Pitt-1962" />

Faced with these advances, on 2 September the German [[Oberste Heeresleitung]] (OHL) issued orders to withdraw to the [[Hindenburg Line]] in the south. This ceded without a fight the [[Salient (territory)|salient]] seized the previous April.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicholson|1962}}</ref> According to Ludendorff "We had to admit the necessity&nbsp;... to withdraw the entire front from the Scarpe to the Vesle."<ref name="Ludendorff">{{harvnb|Ludendorff|1919}}</ref>

September saw the Allied [[Hundred Days Offensive#Advance to the Hindenburg Line|advance to the Hindenburg Line]] in the north and centre. The Germans continued to fight strong rear-guard actions and launched numerous counterattacks on lost positions, but only a few succeeded, and then only temporarily. Contested towns, villages, heights, and trenches in the screening positions and outposts of the Hindenburg Line continued to fall to the Allies, with the BEF alone taking 30,441&nbsp;prisoners in the last week of September. On 24 September an assault by both the British and French came within {{convert|2|mi|km}} of St. Quentin.<ref name="Chron-FWW" /> The Germans had now retreated to positions at or behind the Hindenburg Line.

[[File:World War I Observation Balloon HD-SN-99-02269.JPEG|thumb|An American major, piloting an [[observation balloon]] near the front, 1918.]]

In nearly four weeks of fighting beginning 8 August, over 100,000 German prisoners were taken, 75,000 by the BEF and the rest by the French. As of "The Black Day of the German Army", the German High Command realised that the war was lost and made attempts to reach a satisfactory end. The day after that battle, Ludendorff said: "We cannot win the war any more, but we must not lose it either." On 11 August he offered his resignation to the Kaiser, who refused it, replying, "I see that we must strike a balance. We have nearly reached the limit of our powers of resistance. The war must be ended." On 13 August, at [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]], Hindenburg, Ludendorff, the Chancellor, and Foreign Minister Hintz agreed that the war could not be ended militarily and, on the following day, the German Crown Council decided that victory in the field was now most improbable. Austria and Hungary warned that they could only continue the war until December, and Ludendorff recommended immediate peace negotiations. Prince Rupprecht warned Prince Max of Baden: "Our military situation has deteriorated so rapidly that I no longer believe we can hold out over the winter; it is even possible that a catastrophe will come earlier." On 10 September Hindenburg urged peace moves to Emperor Charles of Austria, and Germany appealed to the Netherlands for mediation. On 14 September Austria sent a note to all belligerents and neutrals suggesting a meeting for peace talks on neutral soil, and on 15 September Germany made a peace offer to Belgium. Both peace offers were rejected, and on 24 September OHL informed the leaders in Berlin that armistice talks were inevitable.<ref name="Chron-FWW" />

The [[Hundred Days Offensive#Battles of the Hindenburg Line|final assault]] on the Hindenburg Line began with the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]], launched by French and American troops on 26 September. The following week, cooperating French and American units broke through in [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] at the [[Battle of Blanc Mont Ridge]], forcing the Germans off the commanding heights, and closing towards the Belgian frontier.<ref>{{harvnb|McLellan|p=49}}</ref> On 8 October the line was pierced again by British and Dominion troops at the [[Battle of Cambrai (1918)|Battle of Cambrai]].<ref>{{cite book|series= For King and Empire: a social history and battlefield tour|title= The Canadians at Cambrai and the Canal du Nord, August–September 1918|publisher=CEF Books|year=1997|last=Christie|first=Norm M|isbn= 1-896979-18-1 |oclc= 166099767}}</ref> The German army had to shorten its front and use the Dutch frontier as an anchor to fight rear-guard actions as it fell back towards Germany.

When Bulgaria signed a separate armistice on 29 September, Ludendorff, having been under great stress for months, suffered something similar to a breakdown. It was evident that Germany could no longer mount a successful defence.<ref>{{harvnb|Stevenson|2004|p=380}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hull|2006|pp=307–10}}</ref>

[[File:US 64th regiment celebrate the Armistice.jpg|thumb|left|Men of US 64th Regiment, [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]], celebrate the news of the Armistice, 11 November 1918.]]

News of Germany's impending military defeat spread throughout the German armed forces. The threat of mutiny was rife. Admiral Reinhard Scheer and Ludendorff decided to launch a last attempt to restore the "valour" of the German Navy. Knowing the government of [[Prince Maximilian of Baden]] would veto any such action, Ludendorff decided not to inform him. Nonetheless, word of the impending assault reached sailors at [[Kiel]]. Many, refusing to be part of a naval offensive, which they believed to be suicidal, rebelled and were arrested. Ludendorff took the blame; the Kaiser dismissed him on 26 October. The collapse of the Balkans meant that Germany was about to lose its main supplies of oil and food. Its reserves had been used up, even as US troops kept arriving at the rate of 10,000 per day.<ref>{{harvnb|Stevenson|2004|p=383}}</ref> The Americans supplied more than 80% of Allied oil during the war, meaning no such loss of supplies could affect the Allied effort.<ref name="Painter 2012 25">{{Harvnb|Painter|2012|p=25}}: "Over the course of the war the United States supplied more than 80&nbsp;percent of Allied oil requirements, and after US entry into the war, the United States helped provide and protect tankers transporting oil to Europe. US oil resources meant that insufficient energy supplies did not hamper the Allies, as they did the Central Powers."</ref>

With the military faltering and with widespread loss of confidence in the Kaiser, Germany moved towards peace. Prince Maximilian of Baden took charge of a new government as Chancellor of Germany to negotiate with the Allies. Negotiations with President Wilson began immediately, in the hope that he would offer better terms than the British and French. Wilson demanded a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary control over the German military.<ref>{{harvnb|Stevenson|2004|p=385}}</ref> There was no resistance when the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrat]] [[Philipp Scheidemann]] on 9 November declared Germany to be a republic.

==== Armistices and capitulations ====

The collapse of the Central Powers came swiftly. Bulgaria was the first to sign an armistice, on 29 September 1918 at [[Saloniki]].<ref name="indiana.edu-1918">{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~league/1918.htm|work=League of Nations Photo Archive|title=1918 Timeline|accessdate=20 November 2009}}</ref> On 30 October, the Ottoman Empire capitulated, signing the Armistice of Mudros.<ref name="indiana.edu-1918" />

On 24 October, the Italians began a push that rapidly recovered territory lost after the Battle of Caporetto. This culminated in the Battle of Vittorio Veneto, which marked the end of the Austro-Hungarian Army as an effective fighting force. The offensive also triggered the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. During the last week of October, declarations of independence were made in Budapest, Prague, and Zagreb. On 29 October, the imperial authorities asked Italy for an armistice. But the Italians continued advancing, reaching Trento, Udine, and Trieste. On 3 November, Austria-Hungary sent a [[White flag|flag of truce]] to ask for an [[armistice]]. The terms, arranged by telegraph with the Allied Authorities in Paris, were communicated to the Austrian commander and accepted. The Armistice with Austria was signed in the Villa Giusti, near [[Padua]], on 3 November. Austria and Hungary signed separate armistices following the overthrow of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. Following the outbreak of the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]], a republic was proclaimed on 9 November. The [[Kaiser]] fled to the Netherlands.
[[File:NYTimes-Page1-11-11-1918.jpg|left|thumb|350px| ''[[The New York Times]]'' of 11 November  1918.]]
On 11 November, at 5:00 am, an [[armistice with Germany]] was signed in a railroad carriage at Compiègne. At 11&nbsp;am on 11 November 1918—"the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month"—a ceasefire came into effect. During the six hours between the signing of the armistice and its taking effect, opposing armies on the Western Front began to withdraw from their positions, but fighting continued along many areas of the front, as commanders wanted to capture territory before the war ended.

The [[occupation of the Rhineland]] took place following the Armistice. The occupying armies consisted of American, Belgian, British and French forces.

In November 1918, the Allies had ample supplies of men and materiel to invade Germany. Yet at the time of the armistice, no Allied force had crossed the German frontier; the Western Front was still some {{convert|450|mi|km|abbr=on}} from Berlin; and the Kaiser's armies had retreated from the battlefield in good order. These factors enabled Hindenburg and other senior German leaders to spread the story that their armies had not really been defeated. This resulted in the [[stab-in-the-back legend]],<ref>{{harvnb|Baker|2006}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Chickering|2004|pp=185–188}}</ref> which attributed Germany's defeat not to its inability to continue fighting (even though up to a million soldiers were suffering from the [[1918 flu pandemic]] and unfit to fight), but to the public's failure to respond to its "patriotic calling" and the supposed intentional sabotage of the war effort, particularly by Jews, Socialists, and Bolsheviks.

The Allies had much more potential wealth they could spend on the war. One estimate (using 1913 US dollars) is that the Allies spent $58 billion on the war and the Central Powers only $25 billion. Among the Allies, the UK spent $21 billion and the US $17 billion; among the Central Powers Germany spent $20 billion.<ref>Gerd Hardach, ''The First World War, 1914–1918'' (1977) p 153, using estimated made by H.

In the aftermath of the war, four empires disappeared: the German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian. Numerous nations regained their former independence, and new ones created. Four dynasties, together with their ancillary aristocracies, all fell after the war: the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollerns]], the [[Habsburg]]s, and the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottomans]]. Belgium and Serbia were badly damaged, as was France, with 1.4&nbsp;million soldiers dead,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7199127.stm "France's oldest WWI veteran dies"], ''BBC News'', 20 January 2008.</ref> not counting other casualties.

=== Formal end of the war ===
A formal state of war between the two sides persisted for another seven months, until the signing of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] with Germany on 28 June 1919. The United States Senate did not ratify the treaty despite public support for it,<ref>{{cite book | last =Hastedt | first =Glenn P. | authorlink = | title =Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy | publisher =Infobase Publishing | series = | volume = | edition = | date =2009 | location = | page = 483 | language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn =1-4381-0989-X | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last =Murrin | first =John | authorlink = | last2 =Johnson | first2 =Paul | author2-link = | last3 =McPherson | first3 =James | author3-link = | last4 =Gerstle | first4 =Gary | author4-link = | last5 =Fahs | first5 =Alice | author5-link = | title =Liberty, Equality, Power: A History of the American People | publisher =Cengage Learning | series = | volume = II | edition = | date =2010 | location = | page =622| language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn =0-495-90383-3 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}</ref> and did not formally end its involvement in the war until the [[Knox–Porter Resolution]] was signed on 2 July 1921 by President [[Warren G.

After the Treaty of Versailles, treaties with Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire were signed. However, the negotiation of the latter treaty with the Ottoman Empire was followed by strife (the [[Turkish War of Independence]]), and a final peace treaty between the Allied Powers and the country that would shortly become the Republic of Turkey was not signed until 24 July 1923, at [[Treaty of Lausanne|Lausanne]].

Some [[war memorial]]s date the end of the war as being when the Versailles Treaty was signed in 1919, which was when many of the troops serving abroad finally returned to their home countries; by contrast, most commemorations of the war's end concentrate on the armistice of 11 November 1918. Legally, the formal peace treaties were not complete until the last, the Treaty of Lausanne, was signed. Under its terms, the Allied forces divested [[Constantinople]] on 23 August 1923.

=== Peace treaties and national boundaries ===
[[File:William Orpen - The Signing of Peace in the Hall of Mirrors, Versailles.jpg|thumb|The Signing of Peace in the [[Hall of Mirrors]], Versailles, 28th June 1919]]
After the war, the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] imposed a series of peace treaties on the Central Powers officially ending the war. The 1919 Treaty of Versailles dealt with Germany, and building on [[Fourteen Points|Wilson's 14th point]], brought into being the [[League of Nations]] on 28 June 1919.<ref>{{harvnb|Magliveras|1999|pp=8–12}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Northedge|1986|pp=35–36}}</ref>

The Central Powers had to acknowledge responsibility for "all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by" their aggression. In the Treaty of Versailles, this statement was [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|Article 231]]. This article became known as War Guilt clause as the majority of Germans felt humiliated and resentful.<ref>{{cite book |ref=harv |first=John H. |last=Morrow |title=The Great War: An Imperial History |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-415-20440-8 |lastauthoramp=y|page=290}}</ref> Overall the Germans felt they had been unjustly dealt by what they called the "[[diktat]] of Versailles." Schulze says, the Treaty placed Germany, "under legal sanctions, deprived of military power, economically ruined, and politically humiliated."<ref>{{cite book|author=Hagen Schulze|title=Germany: A New History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B84ZaAdGbS4C&pg=PA204|year=1998|publisher=Harvard U.P.|page=204}}</ref>  Belgian historian Laurence Van Ypersele emphasizes the central role played by memory of the war and the Versailles Treaty in German politics in the 1920s and 1930s:
:Active denial of war guilt in Germany and German resentment at both reparations and continued Allied occupation of the Rhineland made widespread revision of the meaning and memory of the war problematic. The legend of the "[[stab in the back]]" and the wish to revise the "Versailles diktat",  and the belief in an international threat aimed at the elimination of the German nation persisted at the heart of German politics.  Even a man of peace such as [[Gustav Stresemann|Stresemann]] publicly rejected German guilt.  As for the Nazis, they waved the banners of domestic treason and international conspiracy in an attempt to galvanize the German nation into a spirit of revenge.  Like a Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany sought to redirect the memory of the war to the benefit of its own policies.<ref>Laurence Van Ypersele, "Mourning and Memory, 1919 – 45", on p. 584 in {{cite book|author=John Horne, ed.|title=A Companion to World War I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EjZHLXRKjtEC&pg=PA584|year=2012|publisher=Wiley|page=584}}</ref>

Meanwhile, new nations liberated from German rule viewed the treaty as recognition of wrongs committed against small nations by much larger aggressive neighbors.<ref>The Surrogate Hegemon in Polish Postcolonial Discourse Ewa Thompson, Rice University [http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~ethomp/The%20Surrogate%20Hegemon.pdf]</ref> The Peace Conference required all the defeated powers to pay [[World War I reparations|reparations]] for all the damage done to civilians. However, owing to economic difficulties and Germany being the only defeated power with an intact economy, the burden fell largely on Germany.

Austria-Hungary was partitioned into several successor states, including Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and [[Yugoslavia]], largely but not entirely along ethnic lines. Transylvania was shifted from Hungary to [[Greater Romania]]. The details were contained in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]] and the Treaty of Trianon. As a result of the [[Treaty of Trianon]], 3.3 million Hungarians came under foreign rule. Although the Hungarians made up 54% of the population of the pre-war [[Kingdom of Hungary]], only 32% of its territory was left to Hungary. Between 1920 and 1924, 354,000 Hungarians fled former Hungarian territories attached to Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia.<ref>{{cite book| author = Károly Kocsis|author2=Eszter Kocsisné Hodosi | title = Ethnic Geography of the Hungarian Minorities in the Carpathian Basin| year = 1998| isbn = 978-963-7395-84-0 |page=19}}</ref>

The Russian Empire, which had withdrawn from the war in 1917 after the October Revolution, lost much of its western frontier as the newly independent nations of [[History of Estonia#Road to the republic|Estonia]], [[History of Finland#Independence and Civil War|Finland]], [[History of Latvia#Independence|Latvia]], [[History of Lithuania#Independent Lithuania (1918–40)|Lithuania]], and [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] were carved from it.

The Ottoman Empire disintegrated, and much of its non-[[Anatolia]]n territory was awarded to various Allied powers as protectorates. The Turkish core in Anatolia was reorganised as the Republic of Turkey. The Ottoman Empire was to be partitioned by the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] of 1920. This treaty was never ratified by the Sultan and was rejected by the [[Turkish National Movement]], leading to the victorious Turkish War of Independence and the much less stringent 1923 Treaty of Lausanne.

=== Ground warfare ===
[[File:Austin21.jpg|thumb|right|A Russian armoured car, 1919]]

World War I began as a clash of 20th-century technology and 19th-century [[military tactics|tactics]], with the inevitably large ensuing casualties. By the end of 1917, however, the major armies, now numbering millions of men, had modernised and were making use of telephone, [[Wireless|wireless communication]],<ref>{{harvnb|Hartcup|1988|p=154}}</ref> [[Armored car (military)|armoured cars]], [[tank]]s,<ref>{{harvnb|Hartcup|1988|pp=82–86}}</ref> and aircraft. Infantry formations were reorganised, so that 100-man companies<!--- surely most companies at the start of the war had more than 200-men!---> were no longer the main unit of manoeuvre; instead, squads of 10 or so men, under the command of a junior NCO, were favoured.

Artillery also underwent a revolution. In 1914, cannons were positioned in the front line and fired directly at their targets. By 1917, [[indirect fire]] with guns (as well as mortars and even machine guns) was commonplace, using new techniques for spotting and ranging, notably aircraft and the often overlooked [[field telephone]].<ref>Sterling, Christopher H.; Military Communications: From Ancient Times to the 21st Century (2008). Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO. ISBN 978-1-85109-732-6 p. 444.</ref> [[Counter-battery fire|Counter-battery]] missions became commonplace, also, and sound detection was used to locate enemy batteries.

Germany was far ahead of the Allies in utilising heavy indirect fire. The German Army employed {{convert|150|mm|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|210|mm|0|abbr=on}} [[howitzer]]s in 1914, when typical French and British guns were only {{convert|75|mm|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|105|mm|0|abbr=on}}. The British had a 6&nbsp;inch (152&nbsp;mm) howitzer, but it was so heavy it had to be hauled to the field in pieces and assembled. The Germans also fielded Austrian {{convert|305|mm|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|420|mm|0|abbr=on}} guns and, even at the beginning of the war, had inventories of various calibers of ''[[Minenwerfer]]'', which were ideally suited for trench warfare.<ref>{{harvnb|Mosier|2001|pp=42–48}}</ref>

Much of the combat involved [[trench warfare]], in which hundreds often died for each yard gained. Many of the deadliest battles in history occurred during World War I. Such battles include [[Battle of Passchendaele|Ypres]], the [[First Battle of the Marne|Marne]], [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Cambrai]], the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], and [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]]. The Germans employed the [[Haber process]] of [[nitrogen fixation]] to provide their forces with a constant supply of gunpowder despite the British naval blockade.<ref>{{harvnb|Hartcup|1988}}</ref> Artillery was responsible for the largest number of casualties<ref>{{harvnb|Raudzens|1990|p=421}}</ref> and consumed vast quantities of explosives. The large number of head wounds caused by exploding shells and [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]] forced the combatant nations to develop the modern steel [[helmet]], led by the French, who introduced the [[Adrian helmet]] in 1915. It was quickly followed by the [[Brodie helmet]], worn by British Imperial and US troops, and in 1916 by the distinctive German ''[[Stahlhelm]]'', a design, with improvements, still in use today.

{{col-end}}

The widespread use of chemical warfare was a distinguishing feature of the conflict. Gases used included [[chlorine]], [[mustard gas]] and [[phosgene]]. Few war casualties were caused by gas,<ref>{{harvnb|Raudzens|1990}}</ref> as effective countermeasures to gas attacks were quickly created, such as [[gas mask]]s. The use of [[chemical warfare]] and small-scale [[Aerial bombing of cities|strategic bombing]] were both outlawed by the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]], and both proved to be of limited effectiveness,<ref>{{harvnb|Heller|1984}}</ref> though they captured the public imagination.<ref>Postwar pulp novels on future "gas wars" included Reginald Glossop's 1932 novel ''Ghastly Dew'' and Neil Bell's 1931 novel ''The Gas War of 1940''.</ref>

The most powerful land-based weapons were [[railway gun]]s, manufactured by the [[Krupp]] works, weighing hundreds of tons apiece. These were nicknamed [[Big Bertha (howitzer)|Big Berthas]], even though the namesake was not a railway gun. Germany developed the [[Paris Gun]], able to bombard Paris from over {{convert|100|km|mi}}, though shells were relatively light at 94&nbsp;kilograms (210&nbsp;lb).

[[File:Vickers IWW.jpg|thumb|right|British [[Vickers machine gun]], 1917.]]
Trenches, machine guns, air reconnaissance, barbed wire, and modern artillery with fragmentation [[Shell (projectile)|shells]] helped bring the battle lines of World War I to a stalemate. The British and the French sought a solution with the creation of the tank and [[mechanised warfare]]. The British [[Mark I (tank)|first tanks]] were used during the [[Battle of the Somme]] on 15 September 1916. Mechanical reliability was an issue, but the experiment proved its worth. Within a year, the British were fielding tanks by the hundreds, and they showed their potential during the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] in November 1917, by breaking the Hindenburg Line, while [[combined arms]] teams captured 8,000 enemy soldiers and 100&nbsp;guns. Meanwhile, the French introduced the first tanks with a rotating turret, the Renault FT, which became a decisive tool of the victory. The conflict also saw the introduction of [[Light machine gun|light automatic weapons]] and [[submachine gun]]s, such as the [[Lewis Gun]], the [[Browning Automatic Rifle|Browning automatic rifle]], and the [[Bergmann MP18]].

Another new weapon, the [[flamethrower]], was first used by the German army and later adopted by other forces. Although not of high tactical value, the flamethrower was a powerful, demoralising weapon that caused terror on the battlefield.

[[Trench railways]] evolved to supply the enormous quantities of food, water, and ammunition required to support large numbers of soldiers in areas where conventional transportation systems had been destroyed. Internal combustion engines and improved traction systems for automobiles and trucks/lorries eventually rendered trench railways obsolete.

=== Naval ===
Germany deployed [[U-boat]]s ([[submarine]]s) after the war began. Alternating between restricted and unrestricted submarine warfare in the Atlantic, the [[Kaiserliche Marine]] employed them to deprive the British Isles of vital supplies. The deaths of British merchant sailors and the seeming invulnerability of U-boats led to the development of depth charges (1916), [[hydrophone]]s (passive [[sonar]], 1917), [[blimp]]s, [[hunter-killer submarine]]s ([[British R-class submarine|HMS ''R-1'']], 1917), forward-throwing [[anti-submarine weapon]]s, and dipping hydrophones (the latter two both abandoned in 1918).<ref name="price1980" /> To extend their operations, the Germans proposed supply submarines (1916). Most of these would be forgotten in the [[interwar period]] until World War II revived the need.

=== Aviation ===
:{{Main|Aviation in World War I}}
[[File:Sopwith F-1 Camel.jpg|thumb|right|[[RAF]] [[Sopwith Camel]]. In April 1917, the average life expectancy of a British pilot on the Western Front was 93 flying hours.<ref>Eric Lawson, Jane Lawson (2002).

[[Fixed-wing aircraft]] were first used militarily by the Italians in Libya on 23 October 1911 during the [[Italo-Turkish War]] for reconnaissance, soon followed by the dropping of grenades and [[aerial photography]] the next year. By 1914, their military utility was obvious. They were initially used for [[reconnaissance]] and [[Close air support|ground attack]]. To shoot down enemy planes, [[anti-aircraft guns]] and [[fighter aircraft]] were developed. [[Strategic bomber]]s were created, principally by the Germans and British, though the former used [[Zeppelin]]s as well.<ref name="Cross 1991">{{harvnb|Cross|1991}}</ref> Towards the end of the conflict, [[aircraft carrier]]s were used for the first time, with {{HMS|Furious|47|6}} launching [[Sopwith Camels]] in [[Tondern raid|a raid]] to destroy the Zeppelin hangars at [[Tondern]] in 1918.<ref>{{harvnb|Cross|1991|pp=56–57}}</ref>

Manned [[observation balloon]]s, floating high above the trenches, were used as stationary reconnaissance platforms, reporting enemy movements and directing artillery. Balloons commonly had a crew of two, equipped with [[parachute]]s,<ref>{{harvnb|Winter|1983}}</ref> so that if there was an enemy air attack the crew could parachute to safety. At the time, parachutes were too heavy to be used by pilots of aircraft (with their marginal power output), and smaller versions were not developed until the end of the war; they were also opposed by the British leadership, who feared they might promote cowardice.<ref name=FullCircle>{{harvnb|Johnson|2001}}</ref>

Recognised for their value as observation platforms, balloons were important targets for enemy aircraft. To defend them against air attack, they were heavily protected by antiaircraft guns and patrolled by friendly aircraft; to attack them, unusual weapons such as air-to-air rockets were even tried. Thus, the reconnaissance value of blimps and balloons contributed to the development of air-to-air combat between all types of aircraft, and to the trench stalemate, because it was impossible to move large numbers of troops undetected. The Germans conducted air raids on England during 1915 and 1916 with airships, hoping to damage British morale and cause aircraft to be diverted from the front lines, and indeed the resulting panic led to the diversion of several squadrons of fighters from France.<ref name="Cross 1991" /><ref name=FullCircle />

{{Main|Baralong incidents}}

On 19 August 1915, the German submarine [[SM U-27 (Germany)|U-27]] was sunk by the British [[Q-ship]] [[HMS Baralong|HMS ''Baralong'']]. All German survivors were [[summarily executed]] by ''Baralong'''s crew on the orders of Lieutenant [[Godfrey Herbert]], the captain of the ship. The shooting was reported to the media by American citizens who were on board the ''Nicosia'', a British freighter loaded with war supplies, which was stopped by U-27 just minutes before the incident.<ref>Halpern, Paul G.

On 24 September, ''Baralong'' destroyed [[SM U-41 (Germany)|U-41]], which was in the process of sinking the cargo ship ''Urbino''. According to Karl Goetz, the submarine's commander, ''Baralong'' continued to fly the US flag after firing on U-41 and then rammed the lifeboat – carrying the German survivors – sinking it.<ref>Hadley, Michael L.

The first successful use of [[Chemical warfare|poison gas]] as a weapon of warfare occurred during the Second Battle of Ypres (April 22-May 25, 1915).<ref>A German attempt in January on the Russian front failed to cause casualties.</ref> Gas was soon used by all major belligerents throughout the war. It is estimated that the use of chemical weapons employed by both sides throughout the war had inflicted 1.3 million casualties. For example, the British had over 180,000 chemical weapons casualties during the war, and up to one-third of American casualties were caused by them.

Poison gas was not only limited to combatants but also civilians as civilian towns were at risk from winds blowing the poison gases through. Civilians rarely had a warning system put into place to alert their neighbors of the danger. In addition to poor warning systems, civilians often did not have access to effective gas masks. An estimated 100,000–260,000 civilian casualties were caused by chemical weapons during the conflict and tens of thousands of more (along with military personnel) died from scarring of the lungs, skin damage, and cerebral damage in the years after the conflict ended. Many commanders on both sides knew that such weapons would cause major harm to civilians as wind would blow poison gases into nearby civilian towns but nonetheless continued to use them throughout the war. British [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Sir Douglas Haig]] wrote in his diary: "My officers and I were aware that such weapons would cause harm to women and children living in nearby towns, as strong winds were common in the battlefront. However, because the weapon was to be directed against the enemy, none of us were overly concerned at all."<ref>{{cite book |title=The Poisonous Cloud: Chemical Warfare in the First World War |author=L.

=== Rape of Belgium ===
{{Main|Rape of Belgium}}
The German invaders treated any resistance—such as sabotaging rail lines—as illegal and immoral, and shot the offenders and burned buildings in retaliation. In addition, they tended to suspect that most civilians were potential [[franc-tireurs]] ([[guerrillas]]) and, accordingly, took and sometimes killed hostages from among the civilian population. The German army executed over 6,500 French and Belgian civilians between August and November 1914, usually in near-random large-scale shootings of civilians ordered by junior German officers. The German Army destroyed 15,000–20,000 buildings—most famously the university library at [[Leuven|Louvain]]—and generated a wave of refugees of over a million people. Over half the German regiments in Belgium were involved in major incidents.<ref name="Horne 2001 loc=ch 1–2, esp. p. 76">{{harvnb|Horne|Kramer|2001|loc=ch 1–2, esp. p. 76}}</ref> Thousands of workers were shipped to Germany to work in factories.

The British soldiers of the war were initially volunteers but increasingly were [[conscription|conscripted]] into service. Surviving veterans, returning home, often found that they could only discuss their experiences amongst themselves. Grouping together, they formed "veterans' associations" or "Legions".

=== Prisoners of war ===

[[File:German prisoners in a French prison camp. French Pictorial Service., 1917 - 1919 - NARA - 533724.tif|thumb|left|German prisoners in a French prison camp, during the later part of the war.]]
About eight million men surrendered and were held in [[Prisoner-of-war camp|POW camps]] during the war. All nations pledged to follow the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions]] on fair treatment of [[prisoners of war]], and the survival rate for POWs was generally much higher than that of their peers at the front.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillimore|Bellot|1919|pp=4–64}}</ref> Individual surrenders were uncommon; large units usually surrendered en masse. At the siege of Maubeuge about 40,000 French soldiers surrendered, at the [[battle of Galicia]] Russians took about 100,000 to 120,000 Austrian captives, at the [[Brusilov Offensive]] about 325,000 to 417,000 Germans and Austrians surrendered to Russians, at the [[Battle of Tannenberg]] 92,000 Russians surrendered. When the besieged garrison of [[Kaunas]] surrendered in 1915, some 20,000 Russians became prisoners, at the battle near Przasnysz (February–March 1915) 14,000 Germans surrendered to Russians, at the [[First Battle of the Marne]] about 12,000 Germans surrendered to the Allies. 25–31% of Russian losses (as a proportion of those captured, wounded, or killed) were to prisoner status; for Austria-Hungary 32%, for Italy 26%, for France 12%, for Germany 9%; for Britain 7%. Prisoners from the Allied armies totalled about 1.4&nbsp;million (not including Russia, which lost 2.5–3.5 million men as prisoners). From the Central Powers about 3.3&nbsp;million men became prisoners; most of them surrendered to Russians.<ref>{{harvnb|Ferguson|1999|pp=368–9}}</ref> Germany held 2.5&nbsp;million prisoners; Russia held 2.2–2.9&nbsp;million; while Britain and France held about 720,000. Most were captured just before the Armistice. The United States held 48,000. The most dangerous moment was the act of surrender, when helpless soldiers were sometimes gunned down.<ref>{{harvnb|Blair|2005}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Cook|2006|pp=637&-665}}</ref> Once prisoners reached a camp, conditions were, in general, satisfactory (and much better than in World War II), thanks in part to the efforts of the [[International Red Cross]] and inspections by neutral nations. However, conditions were terrible in Russia: [[starvation]] was common for prisoners and civilians alike; about 15–20% of the prisoners in Russia died and in Central Powers imprisonment—8% of Russians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://profismart.ru/web/bookreader-115250-24.php|title=Максим Оськин – Неизвестные трагедии Первой мировой Пленные Дезертиры Беженцы – стр 24 – Читаем онлайн|publisher=Profismart.ru|accessdate=2013-03-13}}</ref> In Germany, food was scarce, but only 5% died.<ref>{{harvnb|Speed|1990}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Ferguson|1999|ch=13}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Morton|1992}}</ref>

In Russia, when the prisoners from the [[Czech Legion]] of the Austro-Hungarian army were released in 1917, they re-armed themselves and briefly became a military and diplomatic force during the Russian Civil War.

While the Allied prisoners of the Central Powers were quickly sent home at the end of active hostilities, the same treatment was not granted to Central Power prisoners of the Allies and Russia, many of whom served as [[forced labor]], e.g., in France until 1920. They were released only after many approaches by the Red Cross to the [[Allied Supreme Council]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JQGQ|title=ICRC in WWI: overview of activities|publisher=Icrc.org|accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref> German prisoners were still being held in Russia as late as 1924.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,768983,00.html|title=GERMANY: Notes, Sep. 1, 1924|work=Time|date=1 September 1924|accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref>

[[Italian nationalism]] was stirred by the outbreak of the war and was initially strongly supported by a variety of political factions.

Once war was declared, many socialists and trade unions backed their governments. Among the exceptions were the [[Bolshevik]]s, the [[Socialist Party of America]], and the [[Italian Socialist Party]], and individuals such as [[Karl Liebknecht]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]], and their followers in Germany.

[[Benedict XV]], elected to the papacy less than three months into World War I, made the war and its consequences the main focus of his early pontificate. In stark contrast to his [[pope Pius X|predecessor]],<ref>{{cite book|title=History of the Church|year=1981|publisher=Burns & Oates|location=London|isbn=0-86012-091-0|others=Translated by Margit Resch |volume=9|series=The Church in the industrial age|author=Roger Aubert|editor=Hubert Jedin|editor2=John Dolan|page=521|chapter=Chapter 37: The Outbreak of World War I}}</ref> five days after his election he spoke of his determination to do what he could to bring peace. His first encyclical, [[Ad beatissimi Apostolorum]], given 1 November 1914, was concerned with this subject. Benedict XV found his abilities and unique position as a religious emissary of peace ignored by the belligerent powers. The 1915 Treaty of London between Italy and the Triple Entente included secret provisions whereby the Allies agreed with Italy to ignore papal peace moves towards the Central Powers. Consequently, the publication of Benedict's proposed seven-point Peace Note of August 1917 was roundly ignored by all parties except Austria-Hungary.<ref>{{cite web|title=Who's Who&nbsp;— Pope Benedict XV|publisher=firstworldwar.com|date=22 August 2009|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/popebenedict.htm }}</ref>

In [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], in 1914, the [[Public Schools Act 1868|Public Schools]] [[Officers' Training Corps]] annual camp was held at Tidworth Pennings, near [[Salisbury Plain]]. Head of the [[British Army]], [[Lord Kitchener of Khartoum|Lord Kitchener]], was to review the [[cadet]]s, but the imminence of the war prevented him. General [[Horace Smith-Dorrien]] was sent instead. He surprised the two-or-three thousand cadets by declaring (in the words of Donald Christopher Smith, a [[Bermuda|Bermudian]] cadet who was present), "that war should be avoided at almost any cost, that war would solve nothing, that the whole of Europe and more besides would be reduced to ruin, and that the loss of life would be so large that whole populations would be decimated. In our ignorance I, and many of us, felt almost ashamed of a British General who uttered such depressing and unpatriotic sentiments, but during the next four years, those of us who survived the holocaust—probably not more than one-quarter of us—learned how right the General's prognosis was and how courageous he had been to utter it."<ref>''"Merely For the Record": The Memoirs of Donald Christopher Smith 1894–1980''. By Donald Christopher Smith. Edited by John William Cox, Jr. Bermuda.</ref> Voicing these sentiments did not hinder Smith-Dorien's career, or prevent him from doing his duty in World War I to the best of his abilities.

Many countries jailed those who spoke out against the conflict. These included [[Eugene Debs]] in the United States and [[Bertrand Russell]] in Britain. In the US, the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] and [[Sedition Act of 1918]] made it a federal crime to oppose military recruitment or make any statements deemed "disloyal". Publications at all critical of the government were removed from circulation by postal censors,<ref name="Karp-PoW-1979" /> and many served long prison sentences for statements of fact deemed unpatriotic.

A number of nationalists opposed intervention, particularly within states that the nationalists were hostile to. Although the vast majority of Irish people consented to participate in the war in 1914 and 1915, a minority of advanced [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]] staunchly opposed taking part.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pennell|first=Catriona|title=A Kingdom United: Popular Responses to the Outbreak of the First World War in Britain and Ireland|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-959058-2}}</ref> The war began amid the Home Rule crisis in Ireland that had resurfaced in 1912 and, by July 1914, there was a serious possibility of an outbreak of civil war in Ireland.<ref name=autogenerated5>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=584}}</ref> Irish nationalists and Marxists attempted to pursue Irish independence, culminating in the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916, with Germany sending 20,000 rifles to Ireland to stir unrest in Britain.<ref name=autogenerated5 /> The UK government placed Ireland under [[martial law]] in response to the Easter Rising; although, once the immediate threat of revolution had dissipated, the authorities did try to make concessions to nationalist feeling.<ref>O'Halpin, Eunan, ''The Decline of the Union: British Government in Ireland, 1892–1920'', (Dublin, 1987)</ref>

Other opposition came from [[conscientious objector]]s—some socialist, some religious—who refused to fight. In Britain, 16,000 people asked for conscientious objector status.<ref>{{harvnb|Lehmann|van der Veer|1999|p=62}}</ref> Some of them, most notably prominent peace activist [[Stephen Henry Hobhouse]], refused both military and [[alternative service]].<ref>Brock, Peter, ''These Strange Criminals: An Anthology of Prison Memoirs by Conscientious Objectors to Military Service from the Great War to the Cold War'', p. 14, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2004, ISBN 0-8020-8707-8</ref> Many suffered years of prison, including [[solitary confinement]] and bread and water diets. Even after the war, in Britain many job advertisements were marked "No conscientious objectors need apply".

The [[Central Asian Revolt]] started in the summer of 1916, when the [[Russian Empire]] government ended its exemption of Muslims from military service.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-12499.html|title=Soviet Union – Uzbeks|publisher=Country-data.com|accessdate=2013-03-13}}</ref>

In 1917, a series of [[French Army Mutinies]] led to dozens of soldiers being executed and many more imprisoned.

In [[Milan]], in May 1917, [[Bolshevik]] revolutionaries organised and engaged in rioting calling for an end to the war, and managed to close down factories and stop public transportation.<ref name="Seton_6">Seton-Watson, Christopher. 1967. ''Italy from Liberalism to Fascism: 1870 to 1925.'' London: Methuen & Co. Ltd. Pp. 471</ref> The Italian army was forced to enter [[Milan]] with tanks and machine guns to face Bolsheviks and [[Anarchism|anarchists]], who fought violently until 23 May when the army gained control of the city. Almost 50 people (including three Italian soldiers) were killed and over 800 people arrested.<ref name="Seton_6" />

In September 1917, [[Russian Expeditionary Force in France|Russian soldiers in France]] began questioning why they were fighting for the French at all and mutinied.<ref>{{harvnb|Cockfield|1997|pp=171–237}}</ref> In Russia, opposition to the war led to soldiers also establishing their own revolutionary committees, which helped foment the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, with the call going up for "bread, land, and peace". The Bolsheviks agreed to a peace treaty with Germany, the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|peace of Brest-Litovsk]], despite its harsh conditions.

In northern [[German Empire|Germany]], the end of October 1918 saw the beginning of the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]]. Units of the German Navy refused to set sail for a last, large-scale operation in a war which they saw as good as lost; this initiated the uprising. The [[Wilhelmshaven mutiny|sailors' revolt]] which then ensued in the naval ports of [[Wilhelmshaven]] and [[Kiel]] spread across the whole country within days and led to the proclamation of a republic on 9 November 1918 and shortly thereafter to the abdication of [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]].

==== Conscription ====
[[File:Young men registering for military conscription, New York City, June 5, 1917.jpg|thumb|right|Young men registering for conscription, [[New York City]], June 5, 1917.]]
Conscription Was common in most European countries. However it was controversial in British speaking countries.  It was especially unpopular among minority ethnic groups—especially the Irish Catholics in Ireland<ref>Alan J. Ward, "Lloyd George and the 1918 Irish conscription crisis." ''Historical Journal'' (1974) 17#1 pp: 107-129.</ref> and Australia, and the French Catholics in Canada. In Canada the issue produced [[Conscription Crisis of 1917|a major political crisis that permanently alienated the Francophiles.]]  It opened a political gap between [[French Canadian]]s, who believed their true loyalty was to Canada and not to the British Empire, and members of the Anglophone majority, who saw the war as a duty to their British heritage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/history/EPISCONTENTSE1EP12CH2PA3LE.html|title=The Conscription Crisis|publisher=CBC|date=2001}}</ref> In Australia, a sustained pro-conscription campaign by [[Billy Hughes]], the Prime Minister, caused a split in the [[Australian Labor Party]], so Hughes formed the [[Nationalist Party of Australia]] in 1917 to pursue the matter. Farmers, the [[labour movement]], the Catholic Church, and the Irish Catholics successfully opposed Hughes' push, which was [[Australian plebiscite, 1917|rejected in two plebiscites]].<ref>J. M. Main, ''Conscription: the Australian debate, 1901-1970'' (1970) [http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:338722 abstract]</ref>

In Britain, conscription resulted in the calling up of nearly every physically fit man in Britain—six of ten million eligible. Of these, about 750,000 lost their lives; Most deaths were to young unmarried men; however, 160,000 wives lost husbands and 300,000 children lost fathers.<ref>{{harvnb|Havighurst|1985|p=131}}</ref> In the United States, conscription began in 1917 and was generally well received, with a few pockets of opposition in isolated rural areas.<ref>John Whiteclay Chambers, ''To raise an army: The draft comes to modern America'' (1987).</ref>

{{quote|<poem>...&nbsp;"Strange, friend," I said, "Here is no cause to mourn."
"None," said the other, "Save the undone years"...&nbsp;</poem>|[[Wilfred Owen]], ''Strange Meeting'', 1918<ref name="Wilfred Owen 2004" />}}

The first tentative efforts to comprehend the meaning and consequences of modern warfare began during the initial phases of the war, and this process continued throughout and after the end of hostilities, and still is underway, more than a century later.

=== Historiography ===
Historian Heather Jones argues that the historiography has been reinvigorated by the cultural turn in recent years.  Scholars have raised entirely new questions regarding military occupation, radicalizion of politics, race, and the male body.  Furthermore, new research has revised our understanding of five major topics that historians have long debated.  These are: Why did the war begin?  Why did the Allies win?  Were the generals to blame for the high casualty rates?  How did the soldiers endure the horrors of trench warfare?  To what extent did the civilian homefront accept and endorse the war effort?<ref>Heather Jones,  "As the centenary approaches: the regeneration of First World War historiography." ''Historical Journal'' (2013) 56#3 pp: 857–878, esp. p. 858</ref>

=== Memorials ===
[[File:Pagny le Chateau monument morts 002b.jpg|thumb|A typical village [[war memorial]] to soldiers killed in World War I]]
{{Main|World War I memorials}}
Memorials were erected in thousands of villages and towns. Close to battlefields, those buried in improvised burial grounds were gradually moved to formal graveyards under the care of organisations such as the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]], the [[American Battle Monuments Commission]], the [[German War Graves Commission]], and [[Le Souvenir français]]. Many of these graveyards also have central monuments to the missing or [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|unidentified]] dead, such as the [[Menin Gate]] memorial and the [[Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme]].

On 3 May 1915, during the [[Second Battle of Ypres]], Lieutenant Alexis Helmer was killed. At his graveside, his friend [[John McCrae]], M.D., of [[Guelph]], Ontario, Canada, wrote the memorable poem ''[[In Flanders Fields]]'' as a salute to those who perished in the Great War. Published in [[Punch (magazine)|''Punch'']] on 8 December 1915, it is still recited today, especially on [[Armistice Day|Remembrance Day]] and [[Memorial Day]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.histori.ca/minutes/minute.do?id=10200|title=John McCrae|publisher=Historica}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/john-mccrae/ |author=Evans David |title=John McCrae |work=Canadian Encyclopedia}}</ref>

[[National WWI Museum and Memorial]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], is a United States memorial dedicated to all Americans who served in World War I. The [[Liberty Memorial]] was dedicated on 1 November 1921, when the supreme Allied commanders spoke to a crowd of more than 100,000 people.<ref name="kclibrary.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.kclibrary.org/blog/week-kansas-city-history/monumental-undertaking|title=Monumental Undertaking|work=kclibrary.org}}</ref> It was the only time in history these leaders were together in one place—Lieutenant General Baron Jacques of Belgium; General [[Armando Diaz]] of Italy; Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]] of France; General Pershing of the United States; and Admiral [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|D.

Beatty]] of Britain.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY3PZ_Q-s1I|title=1921 Liberty Memorial Groundbreaking Ceremony|date=3 February 2015|work=YouTube}}</ref> After three years of construction, the Liberty Memorial was completed and President [[Calvin Coolidge]] delivered the dedication speech to a crowd of 150,000 people in 1926. Liberty Memorial is also home to the [[National World War I Museum]], the only museum in the United States dedicated solely to World War I.<ref name="kclibrary.org" />

The UK Government has budgeted substantial resources to [[World War I centenary|the commemoration of the war during the period 2014 to 2018]]. The lead body is the [[Imperial War Museum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1914.org |title=Commemoration website |publisher=1914.org |accessdate=2014-02-28}}</ref> On 3 August 2014, French President [[Francois Hollande]] and German President [[Joachim Gauck]] together marked [[Centenary of the outbreak of World War I|the centenary of Germany's declaration of war on France]] by laying the first stone of a memorial in Vieil Armand, known in German as [[Hartmannswillerkopf]], for French and German soldiers killed in the war.<ref name="HartmannswillerkopfMemorial">{{cite news|title=French, German Presidents Mark World War I Anniversary|url=http://www.francenews.net/index.php/sid/224398825/scat/e597bd109c960ae3/ht/French-German-Presidents-Mark-World-War-I-Anniversary|accessdate=3 August 2014|publisher=''France News.Net''}}</ref>

World War I had a lasting impact on social memory. It was seen by many in Britain as signalling the end of an era of stability stretching back to the [[Victorian era|Victorian period]], and across Europe many regarded it as a watershed.<ref>{{citation|author=Mark David Sheftall|title=Altered Memories of the Great War: Divergent Narratives of Britain, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada|year=2010}}</ref> Historian Samuel Hynes explained:

{{quote|A generation of innocent young men, their heads full of high abstractions like Honour, Glory and England, went off to war to make the world safe for democracy. They were slaughtered in stupid battles planned by stupid generals. Those who survived were shocked, disillusioned and embittered by their war experiences, and saw that their real enemies were not the Germans, but the old men at home who had lied to them. They rejected the values of the society that had sent them to war, and in doing so separated their own generation from the past and from their cultural inheritance.<ref name="Hynes1991" />}}

This has become the most common perception of World War I, perpetuated by the art, cinema, poems, and stories published subsequently. Films such as ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front]]'', ''[[Paths of Glory]]'' and ''[[King & Country]]'' have perpetuated the idea, while war-time films including ''Camrades'', ''[[Poppies of Flanders]]'', and ''[[Shoulder Arms]]'' indicate that the most contemporary views of the war were overall far more positive.<ref name="Todman2005">{{Citation|last=Todman|first=Daniel|title=The Great War: myth and memory|year=2005|publisher=Hambledon and London|isbn=978-1-85285-459-1|pages=153–221}}</ref> Likewise, the art of [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[John Nash (artist)|John Nash]], [[Christopher Nevinson]], and [[Henry Tonks]] in Britain painted a negative view of the conflict in keeping with the growing perception, while popular war-time artists such as [[Muirhead Bone]] painted more serene and pleasant interpretations subsequently rejected as inaccurate.<ref name="Hynes1991">{{Citation|last=Hynes|first=Samuel Lynn|title=A war imagined: the First World War and English culture|year=1991|publisher=Atheneum|isbn=978-0-689-12128-9|pages=i–xii}}</ref> Several historians like John Terraine, Niall Ferguson and Gary Sheffield have challenged these interpretations as partial and [[polemic]]al views:

<blockquote>These beliefs did not become widely shared because they offered the only accurate interpretation of wartime events. In every respect, the war was much more complicated than they suggest. In recent years, historians have argued persuasively against almost every popular cliché of World War I. It has been pointed out that, although the losses were devastating, their greatest impact was socially and geographically limited. The many emotions other than horror experienced by soldiers in and out of the front line, including comradeship, boredom, and even enjoyment, have been recognised. The war is not now seen as a 'fight about nothing', but as a war of ideals, a struggle between aggressive militarism and more or less [[liberal democracy]]. It has been acknowledged that British generals were often capable men facing difficult challenges, and that it was under their command that the British army played a major part in the defeat of the Germans in 1918: a great forgotten victory.<ref name="Todman2005" /></blockquote>

Though these views have been discounted as "myths",<ref name="Hynes1991" /><ref name="Fussell2000">{{Citation|last=Fussell|first=Paul|title=The Great War and modern memory|url=https://books.google.com/?id=D9iNQYfeKdwC|accessdate=18 May 2010|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-513332-5|pages=1–78}}</ref> they are common.<ref name="Todman2005" /> They have dynamically changed according to contemporary influences, reflecting in the 1950s perceptions of the war as "aimless" following the contrasting Second World War and emphasising conflict within the ranks during times of class conflict in the 1960s.<ref name="Todman2005" /> The majority of additions to the contrary are often rejected.<ref name="Todman2005" />

=== Social trauma ===
[[File:Cover-of-book-for-WWI-veterans-by-William-Brown-Meloney-born-1878.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1919 book for veterans, from the US [[United States Department of War|War Department]].]]
The social trauma caused by unprecedented rates of casualties manifested itself in different ways, which have been the subject of subsequent historical debate.<ref name="todmanxi-xv" />

The [[optimism]] of ''[[Belle Époque|la belle époque]]'' was destroyed, and those who had fought in the war were referred to as the [[Lost Generation]].<ref>{{harvnb|Roden}}</ref> For years afterwards, people mourned the dead, the missing, and the many disabled.<ref>{{harvnb|Wohl|1979}}</ref> Many soldiers returned with severe trauma, suffering from [[combat stress reaction|shell shock]] (also called neurasthenia, a condition related to [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|pp=108–1086}}</ref> Many more returned home with few after-effects; however, their silence about the war contributed to the conflict's growing mythological status.<ref name="todmanxi-xv" /> Though many participants did not share in the experiences of combat or spend any significant time at the front, or had positive memories of their service, the images of suffering and trauma became the widely shared perception.<ref name="todmanxi-xv">Todman, D. ''The Great War, Myth and Memory'', p. xi–xv.</ref> Such historians as Dan Todman, [[Paul Fussell]], and Samuel Heyns have all published works since the 1990s arguing that these common perceptions of the war are factually incorrect.<ref name="todmanxi-xv" />

=== Discontent in Germany ===
The rise of [[Nazism]] and [[Fascism]] included a revival of the nationalist spirit and a rejection of many post-war changes. Similarly, the popularity of the [[stab-in-the-back legend]] (German: ''Dolchstoßlegende'') was a testament to the psychological state of defeated Germany and was a rejection of responsibility for the conflict. This conspiracy theory of betrayal became common, and the German populace came to see themselves as victims. The widespread acceptance of the "stab-in-the-back" theory delegitimized the Weimar government and destabilized the system, opening it to extremes of right and left.

Communist and fascist movements around Europe drew strength from this theory and enjoyed a new level of popularity. These feelings were most pronounced in areas directly or harshly affected by the war. [[Adolf Hitler]] was able to gain popularity by utilising German discontent with the still controversial [[Treaty of Versailles]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/war_end_01.shtml|publisher=BBC|title=The Ending of World War One, and the Legacy of Peace|first=Martin |last=Kitchen}}</ref> World War II was in part a continuation of the power struggle never fully resolved by World War I. Furthermore, it was common for Germans in the 1930s to justify acts of aggression due to perceived injustices imposed by the victors of World War I.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110199/World-War-II|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080704030736/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110199/World-War-II|archivedate=4 July 2008|title=World War II|work=Britannica Online Encyclopedia|accessdate=12 November 2009|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]]|author1=<Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.>}}</ref><ref>{{citation|last=Baker|first=Kevin|url=http://www.harpers.org/StabbedInTheBack.html |title=Stabbed in the Back!

<blockquote>The 'Age of Totalitarianism' included nearly all of the infamous examples of genocide in modern history, headed by the Jewish [[Holocaust]], but also comprising the mass murders and purges of the Communist world, other mass killings carried out by Nazi Germany and its allies, and also the Armenian genocide of 1915. All these slaughters, it is argued here, had a common origin, the collapse of the elite structure and normal modes of government of much of central, eastern and southern Europe as a result of World War I, without which surely neither Communism nor Fascism would have existed except in the minds of unknown agitators and crackpots.<ref>{{citation |last=Rubinstein |first=W.

=== Economic effects ===
{{See also|Economic history of World War I}}
[[File:The Girl Behind the Gun 1915.jpg|thumb|Poster showing women workers, 1915.]]

One of the most dramatic effects of the war was the expansion of governmental powers and responsibilities in Britain, France, the United States, and the Dominions of the British Empire. To harness all the power of their societies, governments created new ministries and powers. New taxes were levied and laws enacted, all designed to bolster the [[war effort]]; many have lasted to this day. Similarly, the war strained the abilities of some formerly large and bureaucratised governments, such as in Austria-Hungary and Germany.

[[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) increased for three Allies (Britain, Italy, and US), but decreased in France and Russia, in neutral Netherlands, and in the three main Central Powers. The shrinkage in GDP in Austria, Russia, France, and the Ottoman Empire ranged between 30% to 40%. In Austria, for example, most pigs were slaughtered, so at war's end there was no meat.

In all nations, the government's share of GDP increased, surpassing 50% in both Germany and France and nearly reaching that level in Britain. To pay for purchases in the United States, Britain cashed in its extensive investments in American railroads and then began borrowing heavily on [[Wall Street]]. President Wilson was on the verge of cutting off the loans in late 1916, but allowed a great increase in [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] lending to the Allies. After 1919, the US demanded repayment of these loans. The repayments were, in part, funded by German reparations which, in turn, were supported by American loans to Germany. This circular system collapsed in 1931 and the loans were never repaid. Britain still owed the United States $4.4 [[1,000,000,000|billion]]<ref>10<sup>9</sup> in this context&nbsp;– see [[Long and short scales]]</ref> of World War I debt in 1934, and this money was never repaid.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4757181.stm What's a little debt between friends?]". BBC News. 10 May 2006.</ref>

Macro- and micro-economic consequences devolved from the war. Families were altered by the departure of many men. With the death or absence of the primary wage earner, women were forced into the workforce in unprecedented numbers. At the same time, industry needed to replace the lost labourers sent to war. This aided the struggle for [[suffragette|voting rights for women]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Noakes|first=Lucy|title=Women in the British Army: War and the Gentle Sex, 1907–1948|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, England|isbn=0-415-39056-7|page=48}}</ref>

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00104, Inflation, Tapezieren mit Geldscheinen.jpg|left|thumb|[[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|Hyperinflation]] reduced German banknotes' value so much that they could be used as wallpaper. Many savers were ruined.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,641758,00.html|title=Germany in the Era of Hyperinflation|work=Der Spiegel|date=14 August 2009|author=Alexander Jung|accessdate=2013-03-13}}</ref>]]
World War I further compounded the gender imbalance, adding to the phenomenon of [[surplus women]]. The deaths of nearly one million men during the war in Britain increased the gender gap by almost a million; from 670,000 to 1,700,000. The number of unmarried women seeking economic means grew dramatically. In addition, demobilisation and economic decline following the war caused high unemployment. The war increased female employment; however, the return of demoblised men displaced many from the workforce, as did the closure of many of the wartime factories.

In Britain, rationing was finally imposed in early 1918, limited to meat, sugar, and fats (butter and [[margarine]]), but not bread. The new system worked smoothly. From 1914 to 1918, trade union membership doubled, from a little over four million to a little over eight million.

Britain turned to her colonies for help in obtaining essential war materials whose supply had become difficult from traditional sources. Geologists such as [[Albert Ernest Kitson]] were called on to find new resources of precious minerals in the African colonies. Kitson discovered important new deposits of [[manganese]], used in munitions production, in the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]].<ref>{{harvnb|Green|1938|pp=CXXVI}}</ref>

[[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|Article 231]] of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (the so-called "war guilt" clause) stated Germany accepted responsibility for "all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of Germany and her allies."<ref>[[s: Treaty of Versailles/Part VIII|Treaty of Versailles, article 231]]</ref> It was worded as such to lay a legal basis for [[World War I reparations|reparations]], and the same clause was inserted, ''[[mutatis mutandis]]'' "in the treaties with Austria and Hungary, neither of whom interpreted it as declaration of war guilt."<ref>Marls, The Myths of Reparations, pp.&nbsp;231–2</ref> In 1921, the total reparation sum was placed at 132 billion gold marks. However, "Allied experts knew that Germany could not pay" this sum. The total sum was divided into three categories, with the third being "deliberately designed to be chimerical" and its "primary function was to mislead public opinion&nbsp;... into believing the "total sum was being maintained."<ref name=Marks237>Marks, p. 237</ref> Thus, 50 billion gold marks (12.5 billion dollars) "represented the actual Allied assessment of German capacity to pay" and "therefore&nbsp;... represented the total German reparations" figure that had to be paid.<ref name=Marks237 />

This figure could be paid in cash or in kind (coal, timber, chemical dyes, etc.). In addition, some of the territory lost—via the treaty of Versailles—was credited towards the reparation figure as were other acts such as helping to restore the Library of Louvain.<ref>Marks, pp.&nbsp;223–234</ref> By 1929, the [[Great Depression]] arrived, causing political chaos throughout the world.<ref>''World War One: A Short History'' By Norman Stone</ref> In 1932 the payment of reparations was suspended by the international community, by which point Germany had only paid the equivalent of 20.598 billon gold marks in reparations.<ref>Marks, p. 233</ref> With the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]], all bonds and loans that had been issued and taken out during the 1920s and early 1930s were cancelled. [[David Andelman]] notes "refusing to pay doesn't make an agreement null and void. The bonds, the agreement, still exist." Thus, following the [[World War II|Second World War]], at the [[Agreement on German External Debts|London Conference]] in 1953, Germany agreed to resume payment on the money borrowed. On 3 October 2010, Germany made the final payment on these bonds.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2023140,00.html|title=Why Did World War I Just End?|last1=Suddath|first1=Claire|date=4 October 2010|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=1 July 2013}}</ref>
